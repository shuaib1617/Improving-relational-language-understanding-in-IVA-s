      "Just a heads up for my fellow TripAdvisior travelers: Delta \"Partners\" with Alitalia out of Rome. First off, FCO is a terrible airport to travel to/from or through. They are always packed with too few staff (counters & \"TSA\" checkpoints), the flights NEVER take off on time, you can't understand the PA system and a Coke costs 6 Euros. And, I have a problem every time I use Alitalia. They are famous for switching your seats if they have an Alitalia frequent flyer book after you who asks for your seats. They always give first priority to their own frequent flyers. It's happened to me three times now (most recently 9/14), so they still do it. You can go ahead book through Delta, but make sure that it's a Delta flight on Delta equipment. Otherwise, you're taking your chances. These forums are valuable only if you post recent and useful info. If you have a good experience; post it. If it's bad, such as mine; post it as well. Good luck.\n",

      "First of all - let me say - I know baggage allowances exist for good reason - and that we should abide by them - This post is not about that - its about how in certain situations staff really make it hard for customers to like a brand. I was flying Ork-Birmigham on an ATR72 (double prop plane with limited overhead baggage space). I fly this route relatively often - and as often as not hand luggage is take from you and put in the hold. Also - as often as not this plane runs at least 30 minutes late. So I arrive in Cork and would prefer not to have to have bags checked - but they are as its a pretty full flight. C'est la Vie. The flight leaves late due to late inbound craft -(which is a BS excuse really - - a more honest one would be the craft was late because its on an end to end schedule with very tight turnaround times, and we stuffed up somewhere earlier in the day) So I land an hour late and then have to wait for my bags - C'est la vie. On my return leg - I decide to ask at check in should I check my bag - I get advised that if I do there will be a charge (at least 50% of the time that i fly this route I am forced to check it - which of course is free - but I prefer not having to check it). I inform the staff member (Ms Ragdish) that i have no desire to check it, but will it be taken off me. She asks me to present it for weighing - and as it weighs 11KG she says I must pay 40£ to check it. I offered to take something out but she stated that then my laptop case would be over weight. So I had to pay 40£ to have a suitcase taken off me that would have been taken off me anyway. I only offered as having flown the route many times I wanted to assist on making things run smoother. And this was how I was repayed What a lousy customer loyalty reward. Then the PLane ran 75 minutes late. Michael O'Leary from Ryan Air decided a year and a half ago that it wasnt a good idea to muck about as much on luggage restrictions - and moved away from it in favour of better customer services. Aer lingus have apparently decided to try and see if they can make that failed policy work. Can I ask the question of Aer Lingus - If you try to emulate his failed baggage policy, could I implore you to try and at least aim for his successful on time policy? (soap box dismantled)\n",

      "This is not an airline I thought I would ever use. However, I booked a short break and only at the end of the booking did the lady mention it was a Ryanair flight. (Thanks to those of you on this forum that pointed out Ryanair don’t actually permit this; thankfully we were fine). I spent forever obsessing about my hand luggage and in the end opted to take only a rucksack – was only staying 3 nights. As soon as I arrived at the airport I headed straight to their bag measurers to ensure it was the right size. Turns out it could have been double the size and it would still have been okay. However, I needn’t have bothered because no one checked the size or weight of the bag before boarding either of the flights. In fact, as far as I could see no one on either of our flights had their bags checked. I did wonder though if this was because of flight was running late because as we were queuing to board we could see people departing the plane. Funnily enough we taxied right on time and for the return flight we left about 10 minutes late. I spent ages entering the online check in details as there’s a charge for entering information incorrectly. Again, I needn’t have bothered as the guy barely glanced my passport as he tore my boarding pass. When we did get onboard there did seem to be a problem with some people’s luggage as there wasn’t room overhead for everything but they managed to squeeze cases under some people’s seat. The plane seemed clean as far as I could see and the seats were comfy. Only criticism was that the seats did not recline nor were there any pockets on the back of the seat in front of you to store newspapers etc. I didn’t purchase any drinks or snacks as I took my own on board. And the little interaction I had with staff was pleasant enough. Another slightly annoying things was that my mum, who travels on a Barbados passport, had to have her boarding pass stamped before departure or she’s refused boarding. They make this very clear for the departure flight but I didn’t think it was necessary for the return flight. Praise God I decided to check to be on the safe side because it turns out it needs to be stamped in both directions. So, the nightmares I had in the lead up to the flight were unfounded. However, there was a couple at our hotel who flew out on another Ryanair flight and were charged the £40 for being a kilo over weight. To me it begged the question of whether there was something they could have thrown away and purchased once they landed but hey. Would I fly Ryanair again? Probably not of my choosing but if I absolutely had to then I guess I would as long as I was careful to follow all their rules.\n",

      "Just wanted to relieve some of the anxiety for those of you who have booked flights with Globespan and heard the horror stories. I was very apprehensive and expecting some delays, but everything was fine. We flew out of the Hamilton, Ontario, terminal and it was great! So compact, no walking, just park the car, walk in, check in, and on the plane. Wonderful compared to Pearson. Arrived in Dublin, Ireland on time. Flight over was in an older aircraft purchased from an Icelandic airline. We bought economy no frills and it was pretty tight for leg room. If you have long legs, spring for the premier. Other than that, it was just fine - plane left and arrived on time. On the flight home, we got a \"free\" meal and non alcoholic drinks, even though it said on the website you needed to preorder the meals. The people that preordered got a different meal (beef or pasta dish). We got a type of chili with vegetables and a bun with a dessert. Can't say every flight will go as smoothly, but I hope this will help with some of the apprehension involved with this airline.\n",

      "Feb 2nd, 2008 I was at Newark/Liberty airport to pick up a puppy that was being sent to me from a breeder in Texas. Unfortunately this breeder used American Airlines to transport the dog. I had used the useless flight tracker to get updated on the status of flight 558 and tracked the \"Airway Bill/Confirmation number\" to track as well. I called American Airlines Cargo prior to going to the airport. The flight was scheduled to arrive early and I took my family to the airport to pick up our new dog. After waiting for well over two hours after the flight landed, the people representing American Airlines Cargo could not give any information other than \"we don't know where the dog is, there were no dogs on flight 558\". They offered NO direction or help other than asking people to leave the carge office. In fact all four people behind the counter disappeared into a side \"break room\" with a poor attitude and suggessted we call in a few hours to see if the \"packages\" were found. Disgraceful. There were 11 families waiting and as this dragged on with absolutely no communication there was obviously frustration. The solution for the American Airlines employees was to call the airport security. These were families with children waiting and this was an absurd way to handle the situation. I called the breeder who could not get any information. I called American Airlines twice from my cell phone, only to be told that the dog in fact was at Newark airport as the flight had landed with the dog was on it. Not true but this was the only information available. Clearly no one knew what was going on and there is a serious flaw in their tracking capabilities. The fact that an error was made was not the issue. The complete inability of anyone representing AA at the airport or on the phone to address the situation was beyond irresponsible. The people in the cargo office were rude, unprofessional and dismissive. In fact, as we waited there were people from other flights coming to claim pets that were also lost because American Airlines never bothered to put them on the flight. AA systems are dangerously flawed. The employees are incompetenent, don't care and the airline is incapable of being trusted to transport an animal, child or anything of value. These puppies and family pets were left unattended in small crates for an unhealthy amount of time, neglected by American Airlines. They truly think of animals as nothing more than cargo and have zero concern for the health and well being of any animal they are transporting. If they can not responsibly transport a dog, YOU are not safe on this Airline. They have obviously stopped caring at all and should do us all a favor by declaring bancruptcy and get out of a business that has clearly passed them by.\n",

      "The topic of airfare price drops has been done to death I guess but I'll give it another whack. Is Air Canada the worst offender? I am not an experienced air traveller but I was very surprised to find the airfare for the same flights I booked in early February from Australia to Vancouver return (Sep/Oct travel) have dropped by 25% six weeks later! I booked the cheapest fare (economy tango) for my family on our first international trip and I chose Air Canada because it is a direct flight and we have limited time during school holidays. The airlines seem to know when it is holiday time and bump up the prices. I have to say 25% is a significant price drop for the same class seats on the same flights. I am disappointed at losing $2000 and it is an unfortunate lesson. If I could afford the higher fares I gather the tickets would be refundable and I would not lose out, except for the nasty cancellation fee. My tickets are not refundable and I am informed there is no option to rebook at the new lower fare. I wouldn't mind so much if the price drop wasn't so large. If this is a normal occurrence it seems booking with Air Canada is like spending money on a lottery ticket.\n",

      "My family and I booked 4 tickets to New York for a week long stay, a week cruise, and then reurn home. Given that the day the ship returns to port, we will also have to fly back home, I called British Airways and asked in the slim possibility that Internet will not be avaialble on board the ship (distance, technical problems etc) what can be done if anything to ensure that all 4 family members can be together for the long flight back home. It is a very remote possibility that Internet will not be available on board the ship, but who knows.... I just wanted to make sure that we do not have any unplesant surprises. To my dismay they said that airport check-in is possible but do not guarantee that we will all be seated together. They asked for a total of 200EUR to preallocate the seats. I would expect this from a low-cost budget airline but certainly not from BA. I did not ask for a ticket change or any other upgrade or service (like extra luggage or preferential seating) I should pay for, but paying 5000EUR for 4 tickets and then being asked for another 200EUR for the simplest of service, it really bothers me. In my opinion this is a \"nickel and dime\" practice at best. I wrote them an email about it, and they did NOT even respond to it. I would at least expect a typical answer from them. Are my expectations unreasonable (do not overcharge for services, replay to complaint emails)???? Thank you all, Andreas\n",

I'll try to keep this brief. Phx-PHL leg uneventful. Got to PHL and checked in at gate and big problem. They had to downsize the aircraft from a 767 to a 757 and were asking volunteers to give up seats. I had a HUGE event plannd in London next night I could not give my seat up. Finally they had enough volunteers and they tried to split me and my freind up. I said no way she is elderly and can barely walk and needs assistance with everything so they put us back together. Got to LHR safely. Had great trip. Flight back..huge overbook and again asking for volunteers, at least no aircraft downgrade. Left almost on time, not 1 seat to spare. Got to PHL and sat on runway for almost an hour no open gates. I had to reclaim my bag, go through security again, ran with my carryon and laptop to the gate and missed the jet by 5 minutes. I had to stay the night without any of my bags they had already been checked. No clean clothes, nothing. All toiletries sitting in Phx. Got small care package from airline with toothbrush, shampoo thats it. Cell phone dead because charger in suitcase. Lesson learned...pack some clothes and necessties in carryon in case you get stuck, and fly non stop if available.\n",

      "Leaving in 3 weeks for a 14 day cruise with 3 day extensions before and after cruise--so about 3 weeks total. Flying from San Diego (commuter plane) to LAX where we fly British Air to Heathrow and then into Stockholm. Hope to pack in just carry on, not because we don't want to pay for luggage, but because on our last trip, through Heathrow, British Air lost our checked bag(s) in BOTH directions. The carry on suitcase, that I have used successfully in the past, is the 22\" from Costco with 2 wheels only. I did carry it on a year and a half ago on British Air without any problem. Also, it did fit into the sizing frame on an American Air domestic flight this past May, when the LAX porter said \"that bag is too big for a carry on!\" but I am concerned about whether British Air has a new size restriction for carry on bags. The bag measures 23\" from wheels to top, even though it is sold as a 22\". If we are going to have to check this bag after arrival at the airport, I might as well pack in a large bag and not have to worry about what I pack. What are your thoughts?\n",

On one occasion I was travelling with my wedding dress and I emailed ahead just to ask how they would advise I carry it.

When they asked us for our passenger information we provided them with the correct information regarding first and last names. However, when they sent our itinerary, my first name was misspelled. I usually write my name as 'Luuk', while my passport says 'Lucas'. I remember signing emails with Luuk, yet I also know that I gave the correct passport names when asked. When I was at Heathrow airport I first encountered that the name on my ticket didnt match my passport. At that point it wasn't to big a deal, but I got to fly anyway. I tried to change my name at the AIR New Zealand service desk, but they couldnt do it and said that the travel agent had to do it. I'm currently in Australia after stopping over in Hong Kong. I could make all flights with the wrong name, even if that sometimes led to skewed faces. I've contacted the travel agent (Travel Nation) and asked them if they could change my name, since I provided them with the correct names. They told me it couldnt be done, since I already started travelling. Instead the added a note, stating that my first name was misspelled. In the accompanying email (in which my first name was misspelled again as Luuc!!!!!) they stated that 'this is not a guarantee for the USA'. So now I'm getting a bit freaked. I'm sure that I will be able to fly to all my other destinations, but If I cant fly to the US, that would be awfull. Is there nothing that can be done?\n",

I have read reviews where members seem to have a pompous attitude to dress code and snub any form of casual sports wear. My son looks very respectable in his fashion wear and is clean and tidy. I have worked in office environments where business men dressed in suits are offensive due to their uncleanliness but because it is a suit and looks business it is deemed. Dress code is surely subjective for an airport lounge where people are meant to be in holiday mode! Shouldn't the fact that a person is be clean and tidy and respectful be more important than what line of attire they are wearing? I totally agree that a person should dress respectful in terms of not revealing too much flesh but reasonable length shorts and trainers...what is the problem? Maybe there should be a business lounge purely for business attire and an exclusive lounge for respectful people who can wear any fashion provided they are clean, tidy and respectful to others.\n",

      "Just want to give others a heads up that Cheap Caribbean/Apple Group is a company with horrible business practices as well as customer support. Be very aware that when you click on accepting the terms of use this company will not compensate you for any errors they have made. Our experience is a result of this company not disclosing on their website they charge in US currency. However, looking through various sites even US based clients have had several issues regarding this company not providing compensation for legitimate complaints. I have sent the following email to the founder of Apple Leisure and the CEO and they refuse to respond. You will also notice the contact info for this company is very vague on their website. In short, we have booked vacations through many on-line companies that are ethical. THis one is not so do not expect any client support from them..... I am writing today to tell you how disappointed I am in your misleading business practices and disgusted I am with your customer support (a common thread in many reviews for your company). I shop on-line a lot and book trips through on-line travel sites so I am knowledgeable on how things work at check-out. I am from Canada and shop in the US, UK and, of course, Canada. We used Cheap Caribbean last year to book a trip and we were charged Canadian funds (funds were at par) and because of this we assumed your company charges us in our currency. There is NOTHING on the website or at checkout to indicate otherwise. For example, even when we book with Hotwire US we are quoted at checkout USD meaning the final price states clearly USD. Cheap Caribbean does not specify anywhere on the website or on our ticket voucher you charge in USD. There is nothing in your contract either to indicate you charge in USD. We were pretty shocked when we were billed $450+ more than we were invoiced for on our credit card. When I called customer care indicating I expect a refund the differance I was informed by a robotic like human ...we are a US company we charge in USD. I could not get Bobby to understand the issue is not that you charge in USD, you don't tell your customers you charge USD. A call to the supervisor was a waste of time. He could care less. The LAST think a customer wants to here is \"we are not doing anything for you\". So, as a result of this I have filed a complaint with the BBB and had several conversations with my friends and coworkers telling them how misleading this company is and all I spoke to are shocked you do not indicate what currency you charge in. Your refusal to pay back what you should not have charged in the first place will cost you a lot of future business. Your lack of action speaks volumes about your business practices (shady) and you lack of interest in customer satisfaction. Also, you may want to have a supervisor train your service reps. When asked ``How are you`the response of `I am okay`is not professional at all. In addition, perhaps educate your staff that a .com company does not indicate you are US based. I work for a Canadian based company with a .com site. Then again, we are ethical and clearly indicate currency charged on our invoices.\n",

Passengers may only carry small quantities (max. 100 ml per container) of liquids, gels and aerosols in their hand baggage. The packaging of these products must also meet specific requirements. This applies for all passengers departing from or catching connecting flights at airports within the European Union.

      "Just got back from NY. What a wonderful airline. Super quick check in and lounge at Luton. Seats extremely comfortable, with many positions + massage facility. Free drinks and good food with extremely pleasant staff. I can't fault this airline for value for money!! I understand they are having a new lounge and check in at Newark in the near future. We had to spend 7 hours there on our way back and as there is no left baggage facility at the airport and the Silverjet lounge didn't open until midday we couldn't get in to NY for the day which was our intention. However, that is hardly Silverjet's fault and as I understand they are shortly starting another flight to NY presumably the check in will be open for more hours. Anyway the lounge was perfectly comfortable, with plenty of food and drinks should one need it. All in all a great experience and we shall certainly never travel to NY any other way.\n",

I was told overbooking by 10% was “legal” due to it being the \"high travel season.\" This seems to be common practice by Aeromexico, whatever the whatever the season, as I and others have experienced this on numerous occasions with this airline (a friend booked on the next flight had the same experience), convincing me to avoid Aeromexico at all costs. After speaking with an extremely unhelpful and rude supervisor, and explaining our situation, she said she would investigate further and disappeared, only to return 45 minutes later to again repeat there were no seats for us.

      "Beware what you get with budget airlines ... you probably will get what you pay for --- or in my case less. Flew Spirit Airlines from New York to Myrtle Beach and back last week with my wife and two-year old. Of course with kids (especially with safety seats that have to be in window seat to prevent blocking the egress path) I knew we'd be ponying up a significant chunk of change for baggage charges and pre-paid seat assignments. Flights were delayed, lines were long, ground staff was overworked and, with exception of one nice man, rude ... but figured you get what you pay for. Little did I know, you can actually get less than you paid for --- on the return flight the Spirit Airlines computer system was down in Myrtle Beach --- causing in addition to very long lines (always fun with a 2-year old), the loss of all information on who pre-paid for seats and baggage so it would be open seating. Annoying, but we were informed that all baggage would be free and anyone pre-paying for baggage or seat assignments would get a refund by calling the 1-800 number. Other than asking twice for the 1-800 number and never getting it, we did arrive safely in NY two hours late which is not horrible for LaGuardia. However, upon returning and calling the 1-800 number I was informed that since I did check luggage and did use 3 seats - I would not have any money refunded. So you can get less that what you paid for --- even on a budget airline.\n",

Obviously you don't expect or get full service on a short island hop, but it's quite adequate. There may be something in the WI culture (or LIAT training) which doesn't generate an instant but synthetic 'have a nice day' welcome but, if you engage with the staff, my experience was that you receive a warm & informed response.

      "Hi, I'm wondering if it is possible to change the 'return' round trip flights to another departure location?... I originally bought the round trip tickets: \"Toronto->China\" and \"China->Toronto\". In between I'm also planning on going to other nearby countries(Hongkong, Taiwan, Japan). I haven't bought other tickets yet, including the last flight from \"Japan->China\" (the one I'm trying to avoid buying right now) The reason that I bought the roundtrip instead of one way was because originally I was planning on going back to China again after my trips for couple weeks then return to Toronto. But right now something came up and I will have to return early... Basically, I'm asking if there's a way to change my return roundtrip flight from \"china->toronto\" to \"japan->toronto\"? so I won't have to buy another ticket from japan to china just to get on the return flight. :( Please let me know what would be the best option for me.

Perhaps realising that pi55ing customers off is perhaps not the best business strategy in the world and that the same joke is just not funny year after year.

      "Flying to Orlando from Manchester I booked 2 exit seats to get the extra leg room - row 49, seats J+K. 49 H+J had acres of leg room, but 49K had virtually no leg room! The reason is that the exit door has a huge box in front of it, presumably to store the slide to be used in an emergency. Since this is right in front of seat 49K, there is almost no leg room - it is worse than the normal seats! I complained to the steward, who said that there was nothing he could do but to log it as an incident. Fortunately for us, there was no-one sitting in seat 49H so we used H+J and had a great flight - but it could have been much worse. I have written to VA to get my £35 fee refunded - there is no reason to charge extra to get LESS legroom! Robin\n",

      "Flew yesterday from Manchester to Orlando. Routing was originally via Atlanta with 4 hour layover prior to onward to MCO. 10 pax with reserved seating in economy. All pretty routine. Half of party arrives at MAN and calls me as checking out hotel, Atlanta flight overbooked. Heart sinks as travelling first time where it is just me with three sons, and sons girlfriend. So as I am mentally thinking EU261 rules, this is quickly followed up by they want to know if we are willing to switch to non stop flight leaving 30 minutes later. Heck yes, especially with a PE upgrade thrown in. 747-400 (Barbarella): great IFE, pretty good food (chicken well spicy must have read the tomato juice experiment), excellent attentive service. Seat are good pitch, but for me are not the most comfortable with headrest adjustment poor. Economy on way home is going too be a let down for the kids, hey ho. MCO arrival was excellent. We were an hour from wheels down to driving out the rental car garage. Immigration was empty, used new kiosks which worked for 7 out of 10 including sons girlfriend who had not travelled before. We did go through recheck for 3 as their receipts had a cross on. I know some have reported this process being done twice over, with some work to rule type approach but for me it was only for issues with taking finger scan. Grabbed bags, hit the tram and out. So great experience all round, even saw the Dreamliner at MAN ;-) Now just need to ask an EU261 compensation questions and complain about not getting my assigned seats...\n",

They offered me £30 compensation, it cost me £220 in phone bills trying to get someone to look for them. They actually make money from putting you on hold. I found several auction houses in London that sell off \"lost luggage\" and kept doing a search for records. 4 months later, guess what, they were selling off my records that they claim they could not find. On calling up the auction house, they read out a few titles and that confirmed that they were my records. No they were NOT my records they belonged to BA and there was nothing I could do but bid on them again in the hope that I would win back my own records. The ladies in the auction house were very helpful and I did win back my records for £60. 1.2 million bags were \"irretrievably lost\" by BA in 2007. Shocking really.\n",

When I look it up on Delta's website, it says from the US to Europe you get 1 free checked bag. delta.com/content/… We did actually check 2 bags for one of us and one for the other and were not charged. The people next to us in the bag drop were also checking 2 bags per person. We did pay for Economy Comfort, but that doesn't seem to affect what bags you can check. The only logical reason I can see would be if the UK is not considered part of Europe and falls into the \"For all other international flights\" at the bottom of the chart.

      "My boyfriend and I made a trip to Spain(Hong Kong-Madrid and Madrid- Hong Kong). We flied with Aeroflot and had both trips scaling in Moscow. Both going(30th Aug) and coming back(15th Sep), the luggages were spot checked as the suitcase locks were open when we got the luggages back (which we think by Russia Airport Authority as this has never happened since I have transited and been traveling around to any other countries). The going trip to Spain, both suitcase locks were open, broken lock for my boyfriend's case which he bought a new suitcase in Spain later. However, the real disaster was actually the coming back trip!! When we picked up the luggage, we found out that both luggages were broken, there are also 2 breakage spots on my luggage itself, the luggage handle came off and the locks were totally forced broken(so my boyfriend lost totally 2 suitcases for this trip). I have locked them before check-in and my suitcase is the type that came with international lock that can be opened by international key in case the luggage would be spot checked by any airport authority so it should not be forced open in such manner! That aside, when we got home, I opened the luggage just to find out that the things inside were totally flipped over in a big mess! The zipped compartment inside was open and the clothes are all messed up(as messy as a 80% sale basket in the shopping mall), the wrapped present was torn open, wrapping paper and the pieces of present scattered around everywhere in the luggage. Furthermore, my boyfriend's mobile phone(old one with problem which we was thinking to get it fixed in China) and his suit (together with necktie and belt) were stolen! The box of mobile phone was left behind together with the torn open plastic suit bag but both of the items were no where to be found! I tried to call the airline but nobody picked up, now I'm waiting for the reply email which I don't know whether they will even cared to read. Frankly speaking, I have no hope that they will contact us back. So this post is only an example and a warning for you guys to be careful and choose the airline wisely (we bought it because it was the cheapest flight ticket, an obviously resulted as an expensive lesson). For us, this is the first and will be the last time we will ever fly with Aeroflot or transit via Russia. With what had happened, we would not hesitate to pay 100-200 EUR more to get a better flight that transit elsewhere!!!\n",

      "End of March 2012 I made a trip to Manaus, Brazil. It was my first experience with \"long distance travelling\". The flight was booked and payed trough Ebookers.be. The flight itself was made by TAP Portugal. The journey to Manaus was perfect, but on my return happened an unexpected problem. Checking in at Manaus airport for the flight Manaus to Fortaleza, flight made by the Brazilian company GOL, they refused to let me check in. My seat was reserved, but, it seemed that the ticket was not payed by TAP. Even showing my e-ticket and proof of my payment, they refused to let me board. It was at that moment not possible to contact TAP in Brazil or Ebookers. The only way to take that flight was to by another ticket at the GOL-gate, witch costed me 781,00 euro! Arriving at Fortaleza Airport, I adressed myself to the TAP office. They gave me a mailadress where I could make my complaint. Back home, I adressed my complaint first to TAP, but the only answer I received was that I had to fill in the form on their website, witch I did, without any further respons. Since I booked my trip trough Ebookers.be, I repeated my complaint to that company, also by filling in a form on their \"customer-service\" website. You receive an automatic answer with a registration-number and the promise they would answer within 48 hours. 5 days later, I still had no answer. I send them a reminder, but even 2 weeks later, there was no further respons. I send Ebookers another, rather angry mail, on witch they responded the same day with excuses for the delay and the answer that they transmitted my complaint to TAP and that I could expect a compensation by TAP for the extra cost I had to make. Now, 3 months further, I still have no answer or payment by TAP or Ebookers. I presume that mail with complaints are directly transmitted to the \"unwanted mail\" or the \"trash\" map! I don't know how to proceed further in this mather to get any positive answer or repons by either TAP or Ebookers. But it is certain that I cannot recommend these companys for any other trip or flight!\n",

We have just a 45 min connection time between landing in PHX and getting the AA flight to ORD, and so we're not sure if we have to collect our baggage from the carousel and drop it somewhere or if it will be transferred for us so we don't have to worry about it after checking in at LAS, Anyone with experience/knowledge of this can help ease our minds? Thanks!\n",

      "My daughter will be travelling Gatwick/Malaga on her own with her baby who will be 18 months old. She will be taking hold luggage and a small backpack as cabin baggage. She will be fine getting on the plane at each end as she will be able to take the buggy up to the entrance of the plane, but unfortunately it then goes into the hold and is put on the carousel at the other end. Her problem will be how to manage the long walks when departing. The baby is already very heavy and although can walk a bit, will not be able to walk long distances. She is too heavy for my daughter to carry through to security. Has anyone else had this problem? I was thinking of her using special assistance but that really for disabled passengers. Any other ideas would be gratefully received.\n",

      "I made the unfortunate mistake of booking an emergency trip to the UK thru Minneapolis to LGW with Northwest. In the past I always had good luck with MSP but apparently they have been in the midst of runway work and flights are delayed or cancelled willy nilly (although you can bet it's the smaller cities whose flights are cancelled), Couldn't get into Minn to connect with the UK flight and NW \"service\" was little help. Apparently this has been going on frequently, yesterday the flight got to Minn too late to make the connection. If we had been warned earlier in the day, we could have driven to MSP in 4 hours and made the connection. All NW would offer by phone was a late Thurs flight to Detroit that got into LGW on Friday far too late for us. This suggestion also made it clear that NW wasn't going to guarantee we would be able to get to MSP Thursday eiher. Luckily we listened to the business travelers in line and did not trust the info given by phone, so we stayed in line and the in-person clerk (who was also helping unload planes at the same time) was able to reroute us to get to LGW three hours earlier which gives us a good shot at making the services. It may take all of Thursday to get to Gatwick but at least it's a chance if it all goes well. To add insult to this, while on hold with NW, they were playing an ad offering bonus miles to fly into Msp!!! If they had any kind of conscience they would be warning potential passengers of the delays and they all should change their schedules to avoid these delays. Oh, but then they might lose business, better to have a captive angry passenger than no passenger at all. I have not flown United for quite a number of years since that summer period when they were also stranding passengers in Denver and Chicago. I'm afraid that I'll be avoiding NW, especially their Airlink, for at least that many years after this. I can't think of any other business that I have been lied to and manipulated by for years and years as much as by the airlines. There was a time when I really did enjoy traveling, but that was before the hubs, maximizing seat capacity, disappearance of snacks and cancelling flights to make sure the other flights have no empty seats.\n",

      "The flight itinerary is Seattle-Chicago-Zurich with the Seattle-Chicago leg on United and Chicago-Zurich leg on Swiss. The return is the reverse with Zurich-Chicago on Swiss and Chicago-Seattle on United. I selected this routing because I wanted to purchase from United but fly Swiss for the transatlantic. I already have my seat selections on United through the reservation process, but not on Swiss. I have the Swiss confirmation number from the United web site, but, when I go to the Swiss site, I am apparently not allowed to see or manage the Swiss segments on the Swiss website due to the codeshare. I could use some enlightenment on the process for online check-in on both outbound and return flights and seat selection for the Swiss legs so your input much appreciated. I've flown commercially frequently, but am still a bit inexperienced with codeshares. With United-Air Canada booked through United, I could use the AC locater provided by United on the AC web site to get to my reservation. Seems a bit different this time.\n",

      "I was surprised to discover recently that I am only a few hundred miles away from Medallion Status on Delta. I say \"surprised\" because I generally don't fly enough in a year to get the necessary mileage for any kind of airline status. However in this case I benefited from a couple of trips to the west coast earlier in the year, plus two sizable MQM bonuses that I received courtesy of my Skymiles credit card. I have some long haul trips planned for later this year and early next, so decided to have a go at a Mileage Run to get the remaining miles for the status upgrade. Since I'm new to doing Mileage Runs, I decided to try something not too terribly ambitious - just enough miles to push me over the threshold. I've read that ATL is not a great airport to base out of for this sort of activity, but I did find an inexpensive R/T flight to Louisville that departs on a weekday afternoon, has a short layover at SDF, and then returns to ATL by about 8:00 PM on the same day. It cost about $145 altogether and I'll get 1000 miles out of it - not such a great deal in terms of cost per mile, but for a first effort I guess it's not too bad (plus it's a small financial investment if I have to back out at the last minute out for some reason). Anyway, here's my question. My biggest concern with this is that something will happen in Louisville (delays, etc) and I will miss the return flight to Atlanta. Both flights have the same flight number so I am guessing it's the same physical airplane for both legs. Does anyone have any idea if that's a valid assumption? I figure worst case I can do a one-way car rental and drive home (6 hours) if I miss the return, but would obviously rather fly (note that I only need the outgoing miles for the status upgrade, so no real harm done if that happens). That's really all I wanted to know, I guess. I know that FlyerTalk is probably a better venue to discuss this sort of thing, but I am not active over there (yet!). My wife is very dubious about all of this and thinks I am crazy, so I am just trying to allay some concerns. Thanks for any advice you all can offer. -JimG\n",

      "Our flight (Myself and my girlfriend), number AR7575 from Mendoza to Cordoba at 19:25 was cancelled and nobody advises us anticipatively. Due to the cancelation, we miss our flight from Gol Linhas Areas (from Cordoba to Sao Paulo). After 3 hours waiting, the aerolineas employees schedule a flight to Buenos Aieres in 23/06 at 06:00. So 11 hours later and from a different place. They do not arrange another flight to São Paulo, neither a Hotel. We paid everything from our own (USD 150 from hotels and taxis)and went to Buenos Aires without a granted flight to Sao Paulo. It was possible take a flight to Sao Paulo just in 23/06 at 17:55 from TAM Linhas Aereas paying from our pockets (USD 1000 each one). We lost meetings, and personal arrangements in Sao Paulo due to the cancelation. Furthermore we have a lot of stress (nobody grants us that it would be possible to come back to sao paulo). Aerolineas do not do anything to help us. For luck we had money to do everything from our own. We have all the vouchers and receipts to prove the extra spending. It was an unfortunate experience together Aerolineas and Argentina. Never more we would choose this wretched airline. Furthermore, we will charge everything (all the extra costs) from Aerolineas. If necessary we would contact ANAC and the court. I’m a current flyer (special member from LAN/TAM) and never happens to me. Moreover, if I wasn’t a special member from TAM I would not arrived in Sao Paulo because there wasn’t available flight for us and Aerolineas did anything.\n",

This time around when I picked my bag from lost and found at Catania, I also had a dogana tag on it. My bag was supposed to be checked through to the Catania,and it was always going to go through the secure dogana area where it would be scanned, but the bag went missing in Rome so I was not with the bag when it was scanned. My question is did customs open my bag at both airports? Everything in the bag was a mess this time round, but I'm not sure if this was because of the way it was handled.

      "Hi we recently arrived back from a trip and took flights with Airasia form KUL to CEB we had pre-booked meals for both flights along with exit seats. As we are now Coeliacs (no Gluten) we just booked the basic meals eg Chicken and plain rice. Once on board the meals were served and thats when we noticed the ingredients list on the packaging (contains gluten) so we could not eat the food i explained to staff they said to contact customer services and explain. On arrival I contacted Airasia via the website and explained everything eg, The website states that some of the meals may contain gluten, When in fact ALL of the meals had gluten, so I requested a refund of the return flights pre-booked meals which was some 10 days away. This request was of course rejected but i was given a link to the site again to select and pay for new meals lol that of course i cant eat any. Plus Airasia have a 'no outside food policy' I had anticipated that the level of service from them would be zero, so we did bring some snacks. The moral of the story use yoru mastercard as I did and dispute the transaction on return then they wil actually listen as the Booking was made from the UK our rules apply regardless of the lack of clarity on the Airasia site so I will update the outcome, for me its not about the £20 its more about the priciple now so fight on ;)\n",

      "Just saw this from FlyerTalk and the SFO website - \"San Francisco International Airport (SFO) will conduct a series of temporary runway closures during 2013 to accomplish construction activity for federally-mandated Runway Safety Areas. These closures will primarily consist of weekend closures of either Runway 28L or 28R, which are the primary runways for arriving flights. Only one runway will be closed at any given time. During closures, the arrival rate at SFO will be reduced from 60 aircraft per hour to 30 aircraft per hour. Delays for flights originating within a two-hour radius of SFO are expected to occur during peak travel times. Peak times are between 9:00 a.m. to12:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Travelers are strongly encouraged to contact their respective carriers regarding any potential delays.\" flysfo.com/web/…updates The dates listed are ... Jan. 11-14, Jan. 18-21, Jan. 25-28, April 5-8, April 12-15, April 19-22, April 26-29 , June 25-26 and and June 27-28 . Runways 28-L and 28-R are used for long haul takeoffs and for virtually all landings. The important point to note is that flights to SFO originating at an airport within a 2 hour flying time, will be subject to delays. These airports cover most of the west coast, from San Diego (SAN) in the south to Portland (PDX - my home) in the north. Seattle is a 2hr15 flight from SFO, so may not be immune. These delays already happen when bad weather hits SFO, as flights from nearby airports are subject to flow control. Should bad weather and these closures hit on the same day(s) it could be big time problems. If you have a flight to SFO and an onward connection for these dates, as referenced above you'd be advised to contact your airline. If you're planning on connecting via SFO from a nearby airport on these dates, allow an enormous amount of contingency, and even consider avoiding SFO altogether.\n",

My partner and I bought two business class tickets to Belize from San Fransisco and discovered a week later that there were unauthorized charges on our credit card that added up to almost double of the original cost of the tickets. Not only did they try to double charge us but then changed our tickets to coach class on the returning flight. We've been hassling with them for a week to get these issues resolved and so far only one ticket has been changed and only half of the money they owed us has been paid back. After looking this company (aka Solar Tours, Cheapticketabroad.com, etc..) on the BBB website and reading other posts about these companies, we know we are not the only ones who have been scammed. The BBB gives them an F rating. They've had to change their name several times to try and hide the fact that they are a shady company. Doesn't get any worse than that.

EVery flight out of our city was cancelled. Not my fault. Not Aeromexico's fault. These things happen. So, I called them to see how they were going to handle it. They said a refund was not an option. Fine. Act of God, whatever. So they said they would rebook my flight at a different date but they were sold out until the end of the month. And oh, by the way, I would have to pay the difference between the original ticket price and they ticket price of a different date----which was $500 more than the original ticket price, because the only tickets they had available were during the high season. I think that's poor customer service, but okay. Fine. The guy said I had 10 months to redeem it. Well, I called back three weeks later to rebook it, and he said that I only had two days to rebook the flight, that time had passed, they were taking my money and they would not be giving it back. NO ONE told me this when I talked to them originally. They made it very clear I had up to ten months to rebook it at no charge except for any difference in the ticket price. I explained this and asked to speak to a manager or supervisor. The guy on the phone was *extremely* rude though I was trying to stay calm and cordial with him. I asked 4 times before he finally agreed to let me speak to a supervisor. At which time, he put me on hold and left me there for 45 minutes. Finally, I hung up and called back. The same jerk answered the phone. I tried asking to speak to a supervisor again, and he hung up on me. What. The hell. Do NOT book through Aeromexico for any reason.

      "I wanted to pass on my experience to travelers trying to get a passport in under 3 weeks from travel date. I was caught in the Oh s$#% time frame of under 3 weeks and over 2 weeks so I could not make appointment at the Miami passport agency . I scrambled 2 and 1/2 weeks till travel date what should I do? I panicked, I read horror stories and read great stories online. What should I do I ask my self. Wait 1/2 a weeks to make a appointment and hope I can get one before my travel date. One of the passport agency worker actually in a way suggested I should wait and set a appointment. I was scared its almost june summer is here its travel season. If I wait I risk not getting appointment in time. Three phone calls to the passport agency and I get a old man Nice calming voice in my state of panic telling me to expediate it. At the time expediated was 2-3 weeks and the clerk at courts said its the 3 week mark. The passport agent told me do it, my response was what if I don't get it in time he stated \" I had a get out of jail free card.\" At 4 days prior to departure if the application is good I can request a emergancey appointment with the Miami agency.. This gave me the kick in the but to expediate it and the relief I had a back up plan.. I herd rumors that the passport agency is the only functional branch of government now I can say confidently that these people are efficient. It only took 7 days, thats right 7 days not business days but days to get it to my door. I right this so the people who are stuck on the fence at the 2-3 week mark and are scared, don't be scared. The passport agency will do what ever they can not to delay you. Suggestions don't forget to put travel date and send it threw clerk of courts or accepted post offices. These certified places make it alittle quicker than you just sending it, Best of Luck and I hope this helps someone in the same situation I was in. _=) Edited: 8:16 pm, May 28, 2016\n",

      "United decided to not go along with its plan to end complimentary hot meals in economy on some international flights. Hot meals will be included on all Trans-Atlantic and Pacifc international flights again from all UA airports in all classes. Here is the email: Dear Mr.(snip), Thank you for your direct, candid feedback on the test we had planned to launch in the fourth quarter for food choices on some of our flights. We heard you and have decided not to move forward with the test of offering customers buy-on-board options in United Economy on certain trans-Atlantic flights. We will continue to offer complimentary hot meals on those flights. The response from you and many of our corporate customers, even before we launched the test, told us what we would have undoubtedly learned had we proceeded - you value our hot meal service in economy class for international flights. In this environment, where higher costs driven by volatile fuel prices are now the norm, we must continue to tailor products and services so that we provide you with choices and competitive fares. As such, we will continue to be proactive in testing new ideas. On October 1, we will proceed with the test of new, complimentary options for United Business customers on three-cabin aircraft used for domestic routes, which represents 16 daily flights. Customers on these flights will receive complimentary fresh sandwiches, salads, breakfast, snack boxes or snacks, depending on the length of flight and time of departure. They will also continue to enjoy complimentary beverages, including beer, wine and cocktails. We will evaluate the results and determine next steps by the end of the year. It's also important to note that full meals will still be served on our p.s. transcontinental flights. Thank you again for your feedback. We will continue to listen and make changes that enable us in this environment to provide you with the choices you value. Sincerely, Graham Atkinson Chief Customer Officer\n",

      "Hi, An interesting article today from USA today's travel section-- which is essentially an encapsulation of a larger, more detailed article written by the Wall Street Journal-- that discusses historical airfares and what people pay today as compared to 1995 levels. While I've mentioned this before, I thought the article was interesting for two reasons.. First, it does confirm what I suspect most people know to be reality.. that being the **average** air fare paid today is in fact LOWER than what you paid **on average** back in 1995 when adjusted for inflation.. Again, this is an average and applies to only US carriers.. but I do think that it applies to most markets-- some more than others, but most markets.. But the more interesting thing that the WSJ author notes-- is that even when you add in checked bag fees and other fees that didn't exist as separate charges back in 1995 (the WSJ author quotes a figure of $21.66 for these fees in total) it's STILL cheaper.. 16% cheaper with the fees added into the comparison, 21% without the fees added..

      "Here is the description of my terrible experience with FlightNetwork: I needed to book round trip tickets to Copenhagen for 3 people. We searched Google flights for the best deal and found a round trip flight for $843 from Flight Network. Since we needed to book using 3 different credit cards, I called FlightNetwork for the booking to ensure that we all get the same price and availability. First, it takes the agent forever to find the flight I am talking about (even using the flight numbers). Then, the agent tells me that the price I am seeing is due to a “glitch” in the system but they would honour this price. I am put on hold for long periods of time in order for the agent to come to this conclusion. It is already 30 minutes that I’m on the call and I have no new information other than the information I already had accessed online in less than 2 minutes. I tell the agent I would like to book with 3 credit cards and apply a promo code (for $20 discount per booking). The agent then asks me for the credit card numbers. Without asking me for my promo code, she has already applied a random promo code that gives $10 discount. I was frustrated at the incompetence of the agent and the long wait times so I decided I would continue the transaction online. I hang up with the agent, go through the online booking system, put in my credit card, click on “Purchase Now”, only to get a pop up that says the online system could not confirm my fare. I refresh the page and suddenly the flight is showing up at $896. I call back 5 minutes after I’ve hung up with the agent the first time, and she tells me that flight prices have gone up. I now decide to proceed with the booking anyway as it is urgent enough for me to book this flight. Another 45 minutes goes by, again long hold times, and my 3 flights are now booked. I receive emails with details of the booking but no invoice. I told myself I would call the next day to ask about the invoice. The next day, I notice the flight is showing at $843 again! And, on top of that, when I log in to the Air Canada website to manage my booking, the purchase price is actually at $843. So when I call back FlightNetwork, I tell them about this and I also tell them that I can’t even confirm what has been charged because I never received an invoice. Again, more ridiculously long hold times - every time, I ask a question, the agent tells me to hold on, puts me on hold for 5-10 minutes and comes back throwing up an answer she received from someone else. What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question. Initially, the agent tells me that she says I was charged $843 mistakenly. I am so confused. Then, she comes back and says oh no, it was $896 that you were charged. Complete chaos!! She sends me the invoice which says that I am paying $285 for the flight and $611.57 in taxes totalling $896.57. Then I tell her that the flight is back to $843 on their website. She says she cannot see this price in their database. I am literally refreshing the page as I speak to the agent and am seeing $843. I had to send a screenshot of what I am seeing on their website to them to prove that I am seeing this price!! She then says that because the flight is book, she cannot refund the difference but can provide it as a credit due to their price drop protection. I was not satisfied with this but looked like I didn’t have another option so I agree and she tells me that it will appear in my account within 3-5 business days. It has been 4 and still nothing but we will see. During the call, I ask to speak with a supervisor and she tells me that the supervisor will basically tell me the same thing… The total time for this call was 1 hour. Then I finally see the charge on my credit card - I see 2 charges. One with the description AIR CANADA totalling $843 and another with description TASF totalling $53. I google TASF and find out this mean travel agent service fee. I am so furious now as they never informed me that this was part of the price they quoted to me!! It is not even detailed in the invoice. I tried calling and the agent tells me that this doesn’t need to be detailed to me, it is part of the total price but I am still not convinced. This is only $53 but the principle of the matter, I was not informed of the details of the charges to my credit card, let alone the absolutely horrible service, I am sure this is in violation of some consumer protection act or travel agents act. Overall absolutely terrible terrible nightmarish experience with FlightNetwork. Not worth the headache and lack of transparency. Embarrassing that this is a Canadian company.\n",

      "I thought I would share our experience. If you have any questions, please ask. Thomson Flight Booking: Easily done online with no problems. We booked extra legroom seats and we felt the cost was worth it. Seat Selection: This was done online as well and it was simple. My only complaint is that we wanted two aisle seats and it wouldn't let me. Online Check in: I checked in a week ahead of time and printed boarding passes. Again, simple and easy. Night before luggage drop: We dropped off our luggage the night before with no stress or problems. I love being able to do this. Flight: Boarding was on time and very efficient. We did take off about 20 minutes later than planned. The flight was comfortable. We had bought a Boots Meal deal at the airport before we went to the plan. So, we did not purchase anything on the plane. We booked extra space seats and they were good value for my tall husband. The flight is about 3 hours from Manchester. Luggage & Immigration in Naples: we disembarked quickly upon landing to a bus. At immigration, the lines went quickly. We had a little wait for the luggage and then off to our transfer. From landing to our transport heading to Sorrento, it took about 1 1/2 hours. The return trip was just as simple and easy. We were pleased with our flights and now look forward to our trip on the Dreamliner this summer.\n",

      "Good grief this is harder than I thought! Although I certainly understand Boise (or as I call it, Spudville!) is NOT a travel hub of any sort, it just shouldn't be this complicated to buy a ticket online, without involving a travel agent! In looking at Korean Air, Cathay Pacific, etc--one cannot \"start\" from Boise, even though they are partners with airlines that do fly into Boise. I really don't want to travel on two separate tickets. I have also tried Matrix--which is usually very helpful in finding a good \"routing\" and price from Spudville. In the past I've found my itinerary, then just gone to the airline website to purchase the ticket. Worked like a charm for last two trips to Europe! With Bangkok, this isn't working--the fares are MUCH higher on the airlines websites than Matrix, and I can't enter Boise as a starting point. I'm looking at traveling mid January 2012 for about 4 weeks. Flying into and out of BKK is fine. Any suggestions or help is much appreciated! Thanks!\n",

      "We just booked a trip with Sunwing to Mexico over the Christmas holidays and although the property was nice, the flight there and back was a nightmare. We signed up for trip alerts and didn't receive any but one that said they were ontime. Instead they were 4 hours late leaving Toronto and did not notify or communicate this to anyone until 15 minutes before when we were supposed to board. They made us wait for over an hour for a voucher for Lunch and then we got $5, which doesn't buy much more than a coffee at Pearson International. We paid for Premium seats because we had heard the seats were tight and then ours seats were double booked. We were worried about lost bags and went with carry on. When we arrived there were people that had lost luggage, I felt especiaily sad for this young teenage girl who was in tears on the bus ride to the resort. Coming home was no better. Web check in wasn't even offered on the way back Delays again coming home and the sign at the gate continued to read on time, even though they were not. They forced us to check our bags or pay several hundred dollars to carry them on even though we had less then when we went down and the bags were standard carry size for any other airline. We arrived so late that we had to pay for a hotel stay at the airport when we got back. On the 7.5 hour flight down we had one drink service that happened 3.5 hours after we boarded. First and last time flying with Sunwing. You couldn't pay me to fly with them ever again.\n",

Clearly I had no idea when I could travel back to the UK. Clearly this advice was absolute rubbish. The Airline and our travel insurance sorted it all out, no problem.

      "Since Usairways merger with American our service and prices have suffered out of Charlotte. My last experience made me vow to never fly them unless I absolutely had to. My wife and I just returned from a round trip via Delta from Charlotte to Jacksonville, FL. We flew first class cheaper than a coach seat on AA. From the moment we stepped up to the ticket counter in Charlotte until we got our baggage back at the end of the trip, it was amazing to experience the difference in service. The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing. Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat, fresh blankets, pillows, and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground, and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles. Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings. The entire crew was dressed very sharply, smiled, and actually thanked us for flying with them. They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service. Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crews....it is common place on AA. It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable. On each leg of the trip, our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim. AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutes. Best decision we've made to switch our business to Delta.\n",

      "We traveled as a family of 12 (6 children and 6 adults) in Executive Class from JFK-DEL in December 2008 and returned from BLR-BOM-EWR Via Heathrow in January 2009 (also Executive). The inflight service on the flight from JFK (772-200LR) was pleasant and seats were comfortable and were flat for sleeping. The airline's grounds services at JFK is not efficient for a large group. There were no Pre-Boarding areas for Executive or Business classes at the gate. The ground servive at BLR was also very inefficient and transit service at BOM was HORRIBLE. The flight from BOM to EWR on 747 was acceptable with good inflight food service, but non-existent entertainment and the seats were not flat. The transit at Heathrow (a refueling and more passengers stop) was the most miserable experience in all our flying years....We would not recommend to anyone flying through Heathrow as transit passengers. Their security staff is rude and there is no concept of organized boarding at Heathrow. Incidentally, there is barely enough time to exit the plane with all your belongings, go through security and make it back to the gate before the plane is supposed to leave. BOTTOM LINE IS: Fly Air India for Non-Stop flights only to India and expect virtually no ground service.\n",

The problem is that I've asked this question 3 times with 3 different telephone reps at Travel Guard Insurance and I've gotten 3 different answers. I don't think the telephone reps understand this either. My question is this: When buying the policy, you have to put down on the application \"trip cost.\" Using BA Avios points for a Business Class ticket, the taxes and fees which I paid were about $1100. (OUCH !!!) The first agent told me to insure the cost of the actual ticket. (I knew this wasn't correct so I called back.) The second agent told me I could only list the cost to re-deposit the points in case of cancellation. This would be $65 USD. I wanted to double-check, so I called back a 3rd time, and the 3rd agent told me to put down the cost of the taxes and fees. In case of cancellation, I would get the taxes and fees back from BA.

We've never used travel insurance because except on one occasion we've always booked our own flights, hotels, trains, etc. That said - I've noticed a number of posts on this and other boards gently chiding people who've encountered problems in their travels for not purchasing trip insurance policies.

I had purchased tickets for my wife, daughter, and myself online with no problems. Upon arrival at Zacatecas (ZCL) for our flight to Chicago Midway (MDW), they said \"the system\" wouldn't let them check her in because she's two years old (despite the obvious fact to the contrary according to her Mexican *and* US passports). They couldn't get \"el sistema\" to let them issue a boarding pass because we were within the month that she turned two (she was 1 year, 11 months). They gave us the ultimatum: buy a full price ticket or don't fly. Not wanting to miss Thanksgiving dinner, we caved. But, as they were trying to buy the ticket for her as an adult \"el sistema\" wouldn't let them because she was not yet two years old!!! They eventually lied, entered an older age, and gave us the Customer Service number and email address for a refund. Essentially the *same* thing happened on the return flight... except this time they said they had absolutely no record of her ticket and forced us to buy another one. Naturally, customer service at Volaris is a joke in English or Spanish. In Spanish, they'll talk down to you, tell you it was your fault, and stonewall you. They'll refuse to let you speak to a supervisor. In English, they'll sound very nice and helpful and then do nothing, saying they'll call you back after checking with the airport for more details. Surprise, surprise, they never call back. If you then call them back, the supervisor (if you're lucky enough to get one... usually the reps just refuse to connect you) will not take your call, leaving you on hold for hours. If you hang up and work your way through Customer Service to the same supervisor... he'll tell his reps to tell you \"he'll call you right back.\" Two months later, and many, many hours on the phone, still no refund. Next stop PROFECO? Anyone else have this problem? What's the next move (besides obviously never flying with them again and advising everyone I know to do the same)?\n",

      "Hi, has anyone had any problems with HMPO online form when submiting their passport application? I applied for my first adult passport in July/2014 by using the online form available. Approximately six weeks later I received a letter saying I needed to complete a whole new form, this time in paper form. I contacted HMPO and asked why, since my application was complete and with no errors. They told me it was because I had missed Section 4 (details on parents). I went back into the online form, this time taking screen shots with date and time, and surprise, surprise there was no Section 4 in the online version of the form. I was never given the opportunity to write my parents details. I repeated the process several times in different dates and managed to get to the end of the form (screen to complete payment and submit). I tried contacting them by phone, but they insisted that despite the problem I had to go through the whole process again. I tried complaining, had no replies. Phoned again several times, then they finally said they could not find my application, then later on they \"found\" it but that there was no way around it. As a result I have waited for my passport to be processed for more than 8 weeks now - and still no idea when it will be finalised. I read in a similar trip advisor forum (\"Problems with the Passport Office,dated April 2014) that some people, Miss B and Nanny503927 for example, were having similar problems. I would not recommend use of HMPO online form for new applicants... And i was wondering if anyone has had similar issues. Thank you\n",

Two working days later when I checked my itinerary, it was flagged as pending, unpaid. As when I had originally made the payment it said that the booking would only be held for two days I was a little concerned and phoned their customer service department. When I eventually got through, after some discussion I was asked to send a copy of my bank's confirmation of payment, which I duly did. Later that day I found the itinerary was now marked as paid so I was happy enough with that. However, this morning a Jetstar rep called me to check that everything was now OK and ask if I had received my itinerary (which I had). Not only that, but she had to call four times before I was available to take the call, which I thought was pretty good follow up, I would have thought they'd give up after the second try. They did leave voice mail, but only to say they wanted to speak with me personally, so they also didn't take that out and call it good. I was impressed, better service than I expected.\n",

      "I have not flown internationally in a long time....or even domestically since the invention of the TSA. I therefore had some trepidation about the flight, figuring it would be a royal PITA, no food, and generally where the end would justify the means. Wrong. I chose British Airways Open Skies from Newark to Orly because I had always had good experiences with BA. Also, I liked the idea of a smaller plane with less people. It seemed to be a bit more civilized. I was not disappointed even though we traveled economy. The seats were leather and comfy, and not quite as narrow as some. Our seats were the first row in economy, so although not separated by a wall, there was a lot of leg space between our seats and the last row of business class. We were not treated as if we were the inferior class. We received iPads, a full meal which was quite good, as well as a small breakfast snack before landing...all at no additional cost. Upon the return we were two in three seats, which was terrific. We had a sizable snack, a full meal which was also quite good and another snack prior to landing. The flight crew (captain et al) on both flights were terrific....informative and very personable. The flight attendants were very pleasant, professional and helpful...and love the uniforms as they have a chic retro vibe. Along with the pillow and blanket we received a packet with eye shades, socks, and another item I can't recall. Boarding and disembarking were both a breeze although upon Orly arrival we did not have jetway access but had to disembark on the airfield where a bus waited to take us to the terminal. On the return to Newark we hit a wind shear upon touch down which the female pilot handled very admirably. Luggage retrieval was painless...again, due to far fewer passengers. One point...the 757-200 is a narrow body jet. Therefore the aisles are narrower than many other types of aircraft. Therefore, any bump in the air will cause you to bump the passenger in the seat if walking in the aisle, or be bumped if you are seated. Other than that, the flight was like flying used to be, when passengers were treated like humans, and not cattle. IMO, all,others airlines should,take a page out of the BAOS book. I would fly them again in a heartbeat. Now all they need to add is in flight WiFi, and the service would be perfect.\n",

I want to make sure you know I'm not one of those people. When booking my trip I did request assistance from Allegiant with my luggage, moving through the airport and security, to the gate, and on and off the plane. I tried to be as specific as possible as to the assistance I needed since I was traveling alone. These requests were not out of line and should have all been provided by Allegiant. Instead, Allegiant asked my family member who was dropping me off at the airport to help me to my gate which was a huge inconvieniece for them. On my first leg the gate was changed before the flight and another passenger had to move me to the new gate. But that was nothing compared to how I found my wheelchair every time I received it back from Allegiant after landing. After the first leg, the left arm rest was broken off. I didn't say anything at that time thinking that it was just a \"things happen\" situation. I really lost it though when at the end of my second leg, as I was being wheeled down the ramp, the young man who was wheeling me down wheeled my left wheel partially on the edge of the ramp causing the rubber tire to come off my wheel!! Then he started telling me how it was \"normal wear and tear\". REALLY?!?! When my husband and I got back to our car we inspected the chair closer and found that the edge of the back of the chair had a rip in the vinyl!! It's going to cost me more to repair this chair than it will to just replace it. What makes me so angry is that no one says sorry. My husband worked for an entire day to make this chair fit my personality by painting it sparkly hot pink since I have to spend so much time in it. Now though, I'm house bound because they just didn't care to take care of something that is so important to me. I did contact them, I guess they have 30 days to respond.\n",

American Tourister \"Flite\" (Samsonite`s budget range). They`re not the lightest in the world but built like tanks, plastic tanks I grant you, but tanks none the less. You`ll always see loads of them owned by seasoned travellers on airport luggage carousels. They came with a 3 year guarantee, but 4 years later after loads of hard use we needed a spare part for one, it just screwed on and they just put it in the post, for free ! That level of customer service is rare indeed these days. Anyway, earlier this year a friend of mine wanted my advice on what suitcase to buy. I`ve seldom been so certain of any recommendation, buy the American Tourister hard shell suitcases we bought back in 2009, but guess what ? Yes you`re right ! They don`t do them anymore ! In fact they don`t do anything similar and neither does anyone else (well Samsonite do one model, but that was a bit out of her price range). The question is why are all suitcases on the market these days flimsy soft and zipped ? ! ? Edited: 4:15 pm, September 20, 2012\n",

Prior to take off in Perth we were joined in the row in front of us by 3 drunk men who from that moment on set about drinking the cabin dry. After an hour, the one in front of my wife suddenly decided to put his seat into a full recline position hitting my wife in the face. We complained and verbal hostilities arose. We were moved 5 rows back. This was not the end of our troubles. From that point onwards we were threatened contiunally by these men. This was pointed out to the crew. Approaching to land I was told by \"the leader\" that they would be waiting for me in the corridor. This was heard by a Stewardess. A terrifying experience all round. Nothing happened in the corridor but we were on edge continually. Luckily for us, they did not continue on our joining flight to Heathrow. I emailed a complaint to Malaysia Airways and 4 weeks later they have replied sending a 3 line email back saying thanks for my observations and they will review their practices on future flights. The questions is. Do I now leave it at that or is that the best I can expect from a 5 star airline ?????\n",

They are always packed with too few staff (counters & \"TSA\" checkpoints), the flights NEVER take off on time, you can't understand the PA system and a Coke costs 6 Euros. And, I have a problem every time I use Alitalia. They are famous for switching your seats if they have an Alitalia frequent flyer book after you who asks for your seats. They always give first priority to their own frequent flyers. It's happened to me three times now (most recently 9/14), so they still do it. You can go ahead book through Delta, but make sure that it's a Delta flight on Delta equipment. Otherwise, you're taking your chances. These forums are valuable only if you post recent and useful info. If you have a good experience; post it. If it's bad, such as mine; post it as well. Good luck.\n",

      "First of all - let me say - I know baggage allowances exist for good reason - and that we should abide by them - This post is not about that - its about how in certain situations staff really make it hard for customers to like a brand. I was flying Ork-Birmigham on an ATR72 (double prop plane with limited overhead baggage space). I fly this route relatively often - and as often as not hand luggage is take from you and put in the hold. Also - as often as not this plane runs at least 30 minutes late. So I arrive in Cork and would prefer not to have to have bags checked - but they are as its a pretty full flight. C'est la Vie. The flight leaves late due to late inbound craft -(which is a BS excuse really - - a more honest one would be the craft was late because its on an end to end schedule with very tight turnaround times, and we stuffed up somewhere earlier in the day) So I land an hour late and then have to wait for my bags - C'est la vie. On my return leg - I decide to ask at check in should I check my bag - I get advised that if I do there will be a charge (at least 50% of the time that i fly this route I am forced to check it - which of course is free - but I prefer not having to check it). I inform the staff member (Ms Ragdish) that i have no desire to check it, but will it be taken off me. She asks me to present it for weighing - and as it weighs 11KG she says I must pay 40£ to check it. I offered to take something out but she stated that then my laptop case would be over weight. So I had to pay 40£ to have a suitcase taken off me that would have been taken off me anyway. I only offered as having flown the route many times I wanted to assist on making things run smoother. And this was how I was repayed What a lousy customer loyalty reward. Then the PLane ran 75 minutes late. Michael O'Leary from Ryan Air decided a year and a half ago that it wasnt a good idea to muck about as much on luggage restrictions - and moved away from it in favour of better customer services. Aer lingus have apparently decided to try and see if they can make that failed policy work. Can I ask the question of Aer Lingus - If you try to emulate his failed baggage policy, could I implore you to try and at least aim for his successful on time policy? (soap box dismantled)\n",

      "This is not an airline I thought I would ever use. However, I booked a short break and only at the end of the booking did the lady mention it was a Ryanair flight. (Thanks to those of you on this forum that pointed out Ryanair don’t actually permit this; thankfully we were fine). I spent forever obsessing about my hand luggage and in the end opted to take only a rucksack – was only staying 3 nights. As soon as I arrived at the airport I headed straight to their bag measurers to ensure it was the right size. Turns out it could have been double the size and it would still have been okay. However, I needn’t have bothered because no one checked the size or weight of the bag before boarding either of the flights. In fact, as far as I could see no one on either of our flights had their bags checked. I did wonder though if this was because of flight was running late because as we were queuing to board we could see people departing the plane. Funnily enough we taxied right on time and for the return flight we left about 10 minutes late. I spent ages entering the online check in details as there’s a charge for entering information incorrectly. Again, I needn’t have bothered as the guy barely glanced my passport as he tore my boarding pass. When we did get onboard there did seem to be a problem with some people’s luggage as there wasn’t room overhead for everything but they managed to squeeze cases under some people’s seat. The plane seemed clean as far as I could see and the seats were comfy. Only criticism was that the seats did not recline nor were there any pockets on the back of the seat in front of you to store newspapers etc. I didn’t purchase any drinks or snacks as I took my own on board. And the little interaction I had with staff was pleasant enough. Another slightly annoying things was that my mum, who travels on a Barbados passport, had to have her boarding pass stamped before departure or she’s refused boarding. They make this very clear for the departure flight but I didn’t think it was necessary for the return flight. Praise God I decided to check to be on the safe side because it turns out it needs to be stamped in both directions. So, the nightmares I had in the lead up to the flight were unfounded. However, there was a couple at our hotel who flew out on another Ryanair flight and were charged the £40 for being a kilo over weight. To me it begged the question of whether there was something they could have thrown away and purchased once they landed but hey. Would I fly Ryanair again? Probably not of my choosing but if I absolutely had to then I guess I would as long as I was careful to follow all their rules.\n",

      "Just wanted to relieve some of the anxiety for those of you who have booked flights with Globespan and heard the horror stories. I was very apprehensive and expecting some delays, but everything was fine. We flew out of the Hamilton, Ontario, terminal and it was great! So compact, no walking, just park the car, walk in, check in, and on the plane. Wonderful compared to Pearson. Arrived in Dublin, Ireland on time. Flight over was in an older aircraft purchased from an Icelandic airline. We bought economy no frills and it was pretty tight for leg room. If you have long legs, spring for the premier. Other than that, it was just fine - plane left and arrived on time. On the flight home, we got a \"free\" meal and non alcoholic drinks, even though it said on the website you needed to preorder the meals. The people that preordered got a different meal (beef or pasta dish). We got a type of chili with vegetables and a bun with a dessert. Can't say every flight will go as smoothly, but I hope this will help with some of the apprehension involved with this airline.\n",

      "Feb 2nd, 2008 I was at Newark/Liberty airport to pick up a puppy that was being sent to me from a breeder in Texas. Unfortunately this breeder used American Airlines to transport the dog. I had used the useless flight tracker to get updated on the status of flight 558 and tracked the \"Airway Bill/Confirmation number\" to track as well. I called American Airlines Cargo prior to going to the airport. The flight was scheduled to arrive early and I took my family to the airport to pick up our new dog. After waiting for well over two hours after the flight landed, the people representing American Airlines Cargo could not give any information other than \"we don't know where the dog is, there were no dogs on flight 558\". They offered NO direction or help other than asking people to leave the carge office. In fact all four people behind the counter disappeared into a side \"break room\" with a poor attitude and suggessted we call in a few hours to see if the \"packages\" were found. Disgraceful. There were 11 families waiting and as this dragged on with absolutely no communication there was obviously frustration. The solution for the American Airlines employees was to call the airport security. These were families with children waiting and this was an absurd way to handle the situation. I called the breeder who could not get any information. I called American Airlines twice from my cell phone, only to be told that the dog in fact was at Newark airport as the flight had landed with the dog was on it. Not true but this was the only information available. Clearly no one knew what was going on and there is a serious flaw in their tracking capabilities. The fact that an error was made was not the issue. The complete inability of anyone representing AA at the airport or on the phone to address the situation was beyond irresponsible. The people in the cargo office were rude, unprofessional and dismissive. In fact, as we waited there were people from other flights coming to claim pets that were also lost because American Airlines never bothered to put them on the flight. AA systems are dangerously flawed. The employees are incompetenent, don't care and the airline is incapable of being trusted to transport an animal, child or anything of value. These puppies and family pets were left unattended in small crates for an unhealthy amount of time, neglected by American Airlines. They truly think of animals as nothing more than cargo and have zero concern for the health and well being of any animal they are transporting. If they can not responsibly transport a dog, YOU are not safe on this Airline. They have obviously stopped caring at all and should do us all a favor by declaring bancruptcy and get out of a business that has clearly passed them by.\n",

The airlines seem to know when it is holiday time and bump up the prices. I have to say 25% is a significant price drop for the same class seats on the same flights. I am disappointed at losing $2000 and it is an unfortunate lesson. If I could afford the higher fares I gather the tickets would be refundable and I would not lose out, except for the nasty cancellation fee. My tickets are not refundable and I am informed there is no option to rebook at the new lower fare. I wouldn't mind so much if the price drop wasn't so large. If this is a normal occurrence it seems booking with Air Canada is like spending money on a lottery ticket.\n",

      "My family and I booked 4 tickets to New York for a week long stay, a week cruise, and then reurn home. Given that the day the ship returns to port, we will also have to fly back home, I called British Airways and asked in the slim possibility that Internet will not be avaialble on board the ship (distance, technical problems etc) what can be done if anything to ensure that all 4 family members can be together for the long flight back home. It is a very remote possibility that Internet will not be available on board the ship, but who knows.... I just wanted to make sure that we do not have any unplesant surprises. To my dismay they said that airport check-in is possible but do not guarantee that we will all be seated together. They asked for a total of 200EUR to preallocate the seats. I would expect this from a low-cost budget airline but certainly not from BA. I did not ask for a ticket change or any other upgrade or service (like extra luggage or preferential seating) I should pay for, but paying 5000EUR for 4 tickets and then being asked for another 200EUR for the simplest of service, it really bothers me. In my opinion this is a \"nickel and dime\" practice at best. I wrote them an email about it, and they did NOT even respond to it. I would at least expect a typical answer from them. Are my expectations unreasonable (do not overcharge for services, replay to complaint emails)???? Thank you all, Andreas\n",

I'll try to keep this brief. Phx-PHL leg uneventful. Got to PHL and checked in at gate and big problem. They had to downsize the aircraft from a 767 to a 757 and were asking volunteers to give up seats. I had a HUGE event plannd in London next night I could not give my seat up. Finally they had enough volunteers and they tried to split me and my freind up. I said no way she is elderly and can barely walk and needs assistance with everything so they put us back together. Got to LHR safely. Had great trip. Flight back..huge overbook and again asking for volunteers, at least no aircraft downgrade. Left almost on time, not 1 seat to spare. Got to PHL and sat on runway for almost an hour no open gates. I had to reclaim my bag, go through security again, ran with my carryon and laptop to the gate and missed the jet by 5 minutes. I had to stay the night without any of my bags they had already been checked. No clean clothes, nothing. All toiletries sitting in Phx. Got small care package from airline with toothbrush, shampoo thats it. Cell phone dead because charger in suitcase.

      "Leaving in 3 weeks for a 14 day cruise with 3 day extensions before and after cruise--so about 3 weeks total. Flying from San Diego (commuter plane) to LAX where we fly British Air to Heathrow and then into Stockholm. Hope to pack in just carry on, not because we don't want to pay for luggage, but because on our last trip, through Heathrow, British Air lost our checked bag(s) in BOTH directions. The carry on suitcase, that I have used successfully in the past, is the 22\" from Costco with 2 wheels only. I did carry it on a year and a half ago on British Air without any problem. Also, it did fit into the sizing frame on an American Air domestic flight this past May, when the LAX porter said \"that bag is too big for a carry on!\" but I am concerned about whether British Air has a new size restriction for carry on bags. The bag measures 23\" from wheels to top, even though it is sold as a 22\". If we are going to have to check this bag after arrival at the airport, I might as well pack in a large bag and not have to worry about what I pack. What are your thoughts?\n",

On one occasion I was travelling with my wedding dress and I emailed ahead just to ask how they would advise I carry it.

When they asked us for our passenger information we provided them with the correct information regarding first and last names. However, when they sent our itinerary, my first name was misspelled. I usually write my name as 'Luuk', while my passport says 'Lucas'. I remember signing emails with Luuk, yet I also know that I gave the correct passport names when asked. When I was at Heathrow airport I first encountered that the name on my ticket didnt match my passport. At that point it wasn't to big a deal, but I got to fly anyway. I tried to change my name at the AIR New Zealand service desk, but they couldnt do it and said that the travel agent had to do it. I'm currently in Australia after stopping over in Hong Kong. I could make all flights with the wrong name, even if that sometimes led to skewed faces. I've contacted the travel agent (Travel Nation) and asked them if they could change my name, since I provided them with the correct names. They told me it couldnt be done, since I already started travelling. Instead the added a note, stating that my first name was misspelled. In the accompanying email (in which my first name was misspelled again as Luuc!!!!!) they stated that 'this is not a guarantee for the USA'. So now I'm getting a bit freaked. I'm sure that I will be able to fly to all my other destinations, but If I cant fly to the US, that would be awfull. Is there nothing that can be done?\n",

I have read reviews where members seem to have a pompous attitude to dress code and snub any form of casual sports wear. My son looks very respectable in his fashion wear and is clean and tidy. I have worked in office environments where business men dressed in suits are offensive due to their uncleanliness but because it is a suit and looks business it is deemed. Dress code is surely subjective for an airport lounge where people are meant to be in holiday mode! Shouldn't the fact that a person is be clean and tidy and respectful be more important than what line of attire they are wearing? I totally agree that a person should dress respectful in terms of not revealing too much flesh but reasonable length shorts and trainers...what is the problem? Maybe there should be a business lounge purely for business attire and an exclusive lounge for respectful people who can wear any fashion provided they are clean, tidy and respectful to others.\n",

      "Just want to give others a heads up that Cheap Caribbean/Apple Group is a company with horrible business practices as well as customer support. Be very aware that when you click on accepting the terms of use this company will not compensate you for any errors they have made. Our experience is a result of this company not disclosing on their website they charge in US currency. However, looking through various sites even US based clients have had several issues regarding this company not providing compensation for legitimate complaints. I have sent the following email to the founder of Apple Leisure and the CEO and they refuse to respond. You will also notice the contact info for this company is very vague on their website. In short, we have booked vacations through many on-line companies that are ethical. THis one is not so do not expect any client support from them..... I am writing today to tell you how disappointed I am in your misleading business practices and disgusted I am with your customer support (a common thread in many reviews for your company). I shop on-line a lot and book trips through on-line travel sites so I am knowledgeable on how things work at check-out. I am from Canada and shop in the US, UK and, of course, Canada. We used Cheap Caribbean last year to book a trip and we were charged Canadian funds (funds were at par) and because of this we assumed your company charges us in our currency. There is NOTHING on the website or at checkout to indicate otherwise. For example, even when we book with Hotwire US we are quoted at checkout USD meaning the final price states clearly USD. Cheap Caribbean does not specify anywhere on the website or on our ticket voucher you charge in USD. There is nothing in your contract either to indicate you charge in USD. We were pretty shocked when we were billed $450+ more than we were invoiced for on our credit card. When I called customer care indicating I expect a refund the differance I was informed by a robotic like human ...we are a US company we charge in USD. I could not get Bobby to understand the issue is not that you charge in USD, you don't tell your customers you charge USD. A call to the supervisor was a waste of time. He could care less. The LAST think a customer wants to here is \"we are not doing anything for you\". So, as a result of this I have filed a complaint with the BBB and had several conversations with my friends and coworkers telling them how misleading this company is and all I spoke to are shocked you do not indicate what currency you charge in. Your refusal to pay back what you should not have charged in the first place will cost you a lot of future business. Your lack of action speaks volumes about your business practices (shady) and you lack of interest in customer satisfaction. Also, you may want to have a supervisor train your service reps. When asked ``How are you`the response of `I am okay`is not professional at all. In addition, perhaps educate your staff that a .com company does not indicate you are US based. I work for a Canadian based company with a .com site. Then again, we are ethical and clearly indicate currency charged on our invoices.\n",

      "Just got back from NY. What a wonderful airline. Super quick check in and lounge at Luton. Seats extremely comfortable, with many positions + massage facility. Free drinks and good food with extremely pleasant staff. I can't fault this airline for value for money!! I understand they are having a new lounge and check in at Newark in the near future. We had to spend 7 hours there on our way back and as there is no left baggage facility at the airport and the Silverjet lounge didn't open until midday we couldn't get in to NY for the day which was our intention. However, that is hardly Silverjet's fault and as I understand they are shortly starting another flight to NY presumably the check in will be open for more hours. Anyway the lounge was perfectly comfortable, with plenty of food and drinks should one need it. All in all a great experience and we shall certainly never travel to NY any other way.\n",

I was told overbooking by 10% was “legal” due to it being the \"high travel season.\" This seems to be common practice by Aeromexico, whatever the whatever the season, as I and others have experienced this on numerous occasions with this airline (a friend booked on the next flight had the same experience), convincing me to avoid Aeromexico at all costs. After speaking with an extremely unhelpful and rude supervisor, and explaining our situation, she said she would investigate further and disappeared, only to return 45 minutes later to again repeat there were no seats for us. She promised to place us first on a wait list for the flight we had booked.

Also, by obtaining the United Mileage Explorer credit card, the primary person gets priority boarding and 2 checked bags free.

      "Beware what you get with budget airlines ... you probably will get what you pay for --- or in my case less. Flew Spirit Airlines from New York to Myrtle Beach and back last week with my wife and two-year old. Of course with kids (especially with safety seats that have to be in window seat to prevent blocking the egress path) I knew we'd be ponying up a significant chunk of change for baggage charges and pre-paid seat assignments. Flights were delayed, lines were long, ground staff was overworked and, with exception of one nice man, rude ... but figured you get what you pay for. Little did I know, you can actually get less than you paid for --- on the return flight the Spirit Airlines computer system was down in Myrtle Beach --- causing in addition to very long lines (always fun with a 2-year old), the loss of all information on who pre-paid for seats and baggage so it would be open seating. Annoying, but we were informed that all baggage would be free and anyone pre-paying for baggage or seat assignments would get a refund by calling the 1-800 number. Other than asking twice for the 1-800 number and never getting it, we did arrive safely in NY two hours late which is not horrible for LaGuardia. However, upon returning and calling the 1-800 number I was informed that since I did check luggage and did use 3 seats - I would not have any money refunded. So you can get less that what you paid for --- even on a budget airline.\n",

We travelled on LIAT extensively in Jan12 & they were always on time + no probs with baggage; although there was one delayed flight scheduled to leave about the time of ours, so sympathies to those PAXs. Obviously you don't expect or get full service on a short island hop, but it's quite adequate. There may be something in the WI culture (or LIAT training) which doesn't generate an instant but synthetic 'have a nice day' welcome but, if you engage with the staff, my experience was that you receive a warm & informed response. I would recommend them, which is probably just as well because they have a monopoly on many of the intra-Caribbean routes.\n",

I haven't bought other tickets yet, including the last flight from \"Japan->China\" (the one I'm trying to avoid buying right now) The reason that I bought the roundtrip instead of one way was because originally I was planning on going back to China again after my trips for couple weeks then return to Toronto. But right now something came up and I will have to return early... Basically, I'm asking if there's a way to change my return roundtrip flight from \"china->toronto\" to \"japan->toronto\"? so I won't have to buy another ticket from japan to china just to get on the return flight. :( Please let me know what would be the best option for me. Thankss :)\n",

      "So Ryanair seem to have pressed the mute button on the Michael O'Sleary remote control. Perhaps realising that pi55ing customers off is perhaps not the best business strategy in the world and that the same joke is just not funny year after year. Not all publicity is good publicity it appears. So they do seem on the face of it to have made some good improvements. They have a new marketing manager, team and it seems strategy. The website has been completely revamped and IMO looks and feels great. The stupid CAPTCHA thing has been removed. Credit & debit card charges have been reduced to a fair (or is that a fare) level. Reserved seating throughout the aircraft, allowing small handbags to be carried in addition to your carry on and an all round hug me I’m from Ryanair feeling. telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transpo… So anyone flown them recently and did you see improvements in attitude and service?

      "Flying to Orlando from Manchester I booked 2 exit seats to get the extra leg room - row 49, seats J+K. 49 H+J had acres of leg room, but 49K had virtually no leg room! The reason is that the exit door has a huge box in front of it, presumably to store the slide to be used in an emergency. Since this is right in front of seat 49K, there is almost no leg room - it is worse than the normal seats! I complained to the steward, who said that there was nothing he could do but to log it as an incident. Fortunately for us, there was no-one sitting in seat 49H so we used H+J and had a great flight - but it could have been much worse. I have written to VA to get my £35 fee refunded - there is no reason to charge extra to get LESS legroom! Robin\n",

      "Flew yesterday from Manchester to Orlando. Routing was originally via Atlanta with 4 hour layover prior to onward to MCO. 10 pax with reserved seating in economy. All pretty routine. Half of party arrives at MAN and calls me as checking out hotel, Atlanta flight overbooked. Heart sinks as travelling first time where it is just me with three sons, and sons girlfriend. So as I am mentally thinking EU261 rules, this is quickly followed up by they want to know if we are willing to switch to non stop flight leaving 30 minutes later. Heck yes, especially with a PE upgrade thrown in. 747-400 (Barbarella): great IFE, pretty good food (chicken well spicy must have read the tomato juice experiment), excellent attentive service. Seat are good pitch, but for me are not the most comfortable with headrest adjustment poor. Economy on way home is going too be a let down for the kids, hey ho. MCO arrival was excellent. We were an hour from wheels down to driving out the rental car garage. Immigration was empty, used new kiosks which worked for 7 out of 10 including sons girlfriend who had not travelled before. We did go through recheck for 3 as their receipts had a cross on. I know some have reported this process being done twice over, with some work to rule type approach but for me it was only for issues with taking finger scan. Grabbed bags, hit the tram and out. So great experience all round, even saw the Dreamliner at MAN ;-) Now just need to ask an EU261 compensation questions and complain about not getting my assigned seats...\n",

      "BA flight from London to Hong Kong. They lost my luggage full of 78 rpm records. I was devastated, some so rare items, I dare not think about it. They offered me £30 compensation, it cost me £220 in phone bills trying to get someone to look for them. They actually make money from putting you on hold. I found several auction houses in London that sell off \"lost luggage\" and kept doing a search for records. 4 months later, guess what, they were selling off my records that they claim they could not find. On calling up the auction house, they read out a few titles and that confirmed that they were my records. No they were NOT my records they belonged to BA and there was nothing I could do but bid on them again in the hope that I would win back my own records. The ladies in the auction house were very helpful and I did win back my records for £60. 1.2 million bags were \"irretrievably lost\" by BA in 2007. Shocking really.\n",

When I look it up on Delta's website, it says from the US to Europe you get 1 free checked bag. delta.com/content/… We did actually check 2 bags for one of us and one for the other and were not charged. The people next to us in the bag drop were also checking 2 bags per person. We did pay for Economy Comfort, but that doesn't seem to affect what bags you can check. The only logical reason I can see would be if the UK is not considered part of Europe and falls into the \"For all other international flights\" at the bottom of the chart. Obviously I'm not complaining, but I'd like to understand so I know in the future if we are entitled to 2 bags. Thanks.\n",

      "My boyfriend and I made a trip to Spain(Hong Kong-Madrid and Madrid- Hong Kong). We flied with Aeroflot and had both trips scaling in Moscow. Both going(30th Aug) and coming back(15th Sep), the luggages were spot checked as the suitcase locks were open when we got the luggages back (which we think by Russia Airport Authority as this has never happened since I have transited and been traveling around to any other countries). The going trip to Spain, both suitcase locks were open, broken lock for my boyfriend's case which he bought a new suitcase in Spain later. However, the real disaster was actually the coming back trip!! When we picked up the luggage, we found out that both luggages were broken, there are also 2 breakage spots on my luggage itself, the luggage handle came off and the locks were totally forced broken(so my boyfriend lost totally 2 suitcases for this trip). I have locked them before check-in and my suitcase is the type that came with international lock that can be opened by international key in case the luggage would be spot checked by any airport authority so it should not be forced open in such manner! That aside, when we got home, I opened the luggage just to find out that the things inside were totally flipped over in a big mess! The zipped compartment inside was open and the clothes are all messed up(as messy as a 80% sale basket in the shopping mall), the wrapped present was torn open, wrapping paper and the pieces of present scattered around everywhere in the luggage. Furthermore, my boyfriend's mobile phone(old one with problem which we was thinking to get it fixed in China) and his suit (together with necktie and belt) were stolen! The box of mobile phone was left behind together with the torn open plastic suit bag but both of the items were no where to be found! I tried to call the airline but nobody picked up, now I'm waiting for the reply email which I don't know whether they will even cared to read. Frankly speaking, I have no hope that they will contact us back. So this post is only an example and a warning for you guys to be careful and choose the airline wisely (we bought it because it was the cheapest flight ticket, an obviously resulted as an expensive lesson). For us, this is the first and will be the last time we will ever fly with Aeroflot or transit via Russia. With what had happened, we would not hesitate to pay 100-200 EUR more to get a better flight that transit elsewhere!!!\n",

      "End of March 2012 I made a trip to Manaus, Brazil. It was my first experience with \"long distance travelling\". The flight was booked and payed trough Ebookers.be. The flight itself was made by TAP Portugal. The journey to Manaus was perfect, but on my return happened an unexpected problem. Checking in at Manaus airport for the flight Manaus to Fortaleza, flight made by the Brazilian company GOL, they refused to let me check in. My seat was reserved, but, it seemed that the ticket was not payed by TAP. Even showing my e-ticket and proof of my payment, they refused to let me board. It was at that moment not possible to contact TAP in Brazil or Ebookers. The only way to take that flight was to by another ticket at the GOL-gate, witch costed me 781,00 euro! Arriving at Fortaleza Airport, I adressed myself to the TAP office. They gave me a mailadress where I could make my complaint. Back home, I adressed my complaint first to TAP, but the only answer I received was that I had to fill in the form on their website, witch I did, without any further respons. Since I booked my trip trough Ebookers.be, I repeated my complaint to that company, also by filling in a form on their \"customer-service\" website. You receive an automatic answer with a registration-number and the promise they would answer within 48 hours. 5 days later, I still had no answer. I send them a reminder, but even 2 weeks later, there was no further respons. I send Ebookers another, rather angry mail, on witch they responded the same day with excuses for the delay and the answer that they transmitted my complaint to TAP and that I could expect a compensation by TAP for the extra cost I had to make. Now, 3 months further, I still have no answer or payment by TAP or Ebookers. I presume that mail with complaints are directly transmitted to the \"unwanted mail\" or the \"trash\" map! I don't know how to proceed further in this mather to get any positive answer or repons by either TAP or Ebookers. But it is certain that I cannot recommend these companys for any other trip or flight!\n",

We have just a 45 min connection time between landing in PHX and getting the AA flight to ORD, and so we're not sure if we have to collect our baggage from the carousel and drop it somewhere or if it will be transferred for us so we don't have to worry about it after checking in at LAS, Anyone with experience/knowledge of this can help ease our minds? Thanks!\n",

      "My daughter will be travelling Gatwick/Malaga on her own with her baby who will be 18 months old. She will be taking hold luggage and a small backpack as cabin baggage. She will be fine getting on the plane at each end as she will be able to take the buggy up to the entrance of the plane, but unfortunately it then goes into the hold and is put on the carousel at the other end. Her problem will be how to manage the long walks when departing. The baby is already very heavy and although can walk a bit, will not be able to walk long distances. She is too heavy for my daughter to carry through to security. Has anyone else had this problem? I was thinking of her using special assistance but that really for disabled passengers. Any other ideas would be gratefully received.\n",

      "I made the unfortunate mistake of booking an emergency trip to the UK thru Minneapolis to LGW with Northwest. In the past I always had good luck with MSP but apparently they have been in the midst of runway work and flights are delayed or cancelled willy nilly (although you can bet it's the smaller cities whose flights are cancelled), Couldn't get into Minn to connect with the UK flight and NW \"service\" was little help. Apparently this has been going on frequently, yesterday the flight got to Minn too late to make the connection. If we had been warned earlier in the day, we could have driven to MSP in 4 hours and made the connection. All NW would offer by phone was a late Thurs flight to Detroit that got into LGW on Friday far too late for us. This suggestion also made it clear that NW wasn't going to guarantee we would be able to get to MSP Thursday eiher. Luckily we listened to the business travelers in line and did not trust the info given by phone, so we stayed in line and the in-person clerk (who was also helping unload planes at the same time) was able to reroute us to get to LGW three hours earlier which gives us a good shot at making the services. It may take all of Thursday to get to Gatwick but at least it's a chance if it all goes well. To add insult to this, while on hold with NW, they were playing an ad offering bonus miles to fly into Msp!!! If they had any kind of conscience they would be warning potential passengers of the delays and they all should change their schedules to avoid these delays. Oh, but then they might lose business, better to have a captive angry passenger than no passenger at all. I have not flown United for quite a number of years since that summer period when they were also stranding passengers in Denver and Chicago. I'm afraid that I'll be avoiding NW, especially their Airlink, for at least that many years after this. I can't think of any other business that I have been lied to and manipulated by for years and years as much as by the airlines. There was a time when I really did enjoy traveling, but that was before the hubs, maximizing seat capacity, disappearance of snacks and cancelling flights to make sure the other flights have no empty seats.\n",

      "The flight itinerary is Seattle-Chicago-Zurich with the Seattle-Chicago leg on United and Chicago-Zurich leg on Swiss. The return is the reverse with Zurich-Chicago on Swiss and Chicago-Seattle on United. I selected this routing because I wanted to purchase from United but fly Swiss for the transatlantic. I already have my seat selections on United through the reservation process, but not on Swiss. I have the Swiss confirmation number from the United web site, but, when I go to the Swiss site, I am apparently not allowed to see or manage the Swiss segments on the Swiss website due to the codeshare. I could use some enlightenment on the process for online check-in on both outbound and return flights and seat selection for the Swiss legs so your input much appreciated. I've flown commercially frequently, but am still a bit inexperienced with codeshares. With United-Air Canada booked through United, I could use the AC locater provided by United on the AC web site to get to my reservation. Seems a bit different this time.\n",

      "I was surprised to discover recently that I am only a few hundred miles away from Medallion Status on Delta. I say \"surprised\" because I generally don't fly enough in a year to get the necessary mileage for any kind of airline status. However in this case I benefited from a couple of trips to the west coast earlier in the year, plus two sizable MQM bonuses that I received courtesy of my Skymiles credit card. I have some long haul trips planned for later this year and early next, so decided to have a go at a Mileage Run to get the remaining miles for the status upgrade. Since I'm new to doing Mileage Runs, I decided to try something not too terribly ambitious - just enough miles to push me over the threshold. I've read that ATL is not a great airport to base out of for this sort of activity, but I did find an inexpensive R/T flight to Louisville that departs on a weekday afternoon, has a short layover at SDF, and then returns to ATL by about 8:00 PM on the same day. It cost about $145 altogether and I'll get 1000 miles out of it - not such a great deal in terms of cost per mile, but for a first effort I guess it's not too bad (plus it's a small financial investment if I have to back out at the last minute out for some reason). Anyway, here's my question. My biggest concern with this is that something will happen in Louisville (delays, etc) and I will miss the return flight to Atlanta. Both flights have the same flight number so I am guessing it's the same physical airplane for both legs. Does anyone have any idea if that's a valid assumption? I figure worst case I can do a one-way car rental and drive home (6 hours) if I miss the return, but would obviously rather fly (note that I only need the outgoing miles for the status upgrade, so no real harm done if that happens). That's really all I wanted to know, I guess. I know that FlyerTalk is probably a better venue to discuss this sort of thing, but I am not active over there (yet!). My wife is very dubious about all of this and thinks I am crazy, so I am just trying to allay some concerns. Thanks for any advice you all can offer. -JimG\n",

      "Our flight (Myself and my girlfriend), number AR7575 from Mendoza to Cordoba at 19:25 was cancelled and nobody advises us anticipatively. Due to the cancelation, we miss our flight from Gol Linhas Areas (from Cordoba to Sao Paulo). After 3 hours waiting, the aerolineas employees schedule a flight to Buenos Aieres in 23/06 at 06:00. So 11 hours later and from a different place. They do not arrange another flight to São Paulo, neither a Hotel. We paid everything from our own (USD 150 from hotels and taxis)and went to Buenos Aires without a granted flight to Sao Paulo. It was possible take a flight to Sao Paulo just in 23/06 at 17:55 from TAM Linhas Aereas paying from our pockets (USD 1000 each one). We lost meetings, and personal arrangements in Sao Paulo due to the cancelation. Furthermore we have a lot of stress (nobody grants us that it would be possible to come back to sao paulo). Aerolineas do not do anything to help us. For luck we had money to do everything from our own. We have all the vouchers and receipts to prove the extra spending. It was an unfortunate experience together Aerolineas and Argentina. Never more we would choose this wretched airline. Furthermore, we will charge everything (all the extra costs) from Aerolineas. If necessary we would contact ANAC and the court. I’m a current flyer (special member from LAN/TAM) and never happens to me. Moreover, if I wasn’t a special member from TAM I would not arrived in Sao Paulo because there wasn’t available flight for us and Aerolineas did anything.\n",

This time around when I picked my bag from lost and found at Catania, I also had a dogana tag on it. My bag was supposed to be checked through to the Catania,and it was always going to go through the secure dogana area where it would be scanned, but the bag went missing in Rome so I was not with the bag when it was scanned. My question is did customs open my bag at both airports? Everything in the bag was a mess this time round, but I'm not sure if this was because of the way it was handled.

      "Hi we recently arrived back from a trip and took flights with Airasia form KUL to CEB we had pre-booked meals for both flights along with exit seats. As we are now Coeliacs (no Gluten) we just booked the basic meals eg Chicken and plain rice. Once on board the meals were served and thats when we noticed the ingredients list on the packaging (contains gluten) so we could not eat the food i explained to staff they said to contact customer services and explain. On arrival I contacted Airasia via the website and explained everything eg, The website states that some of the meals may contain gluten, When in fact ALL of the meals had gluten, so I requested a refund of the return flights pre-booked meals which was some 10 days away. This request was of course rejected but i was given a link to the site again to select and pay for new meals lol that of course i cant eat any. Plus Airasia have a 'no outside food policy' I had anticipated that the level of service from them would be zero, so we did bring some snacks. The moral of the story use yoru mastercard as I did and dispute the transaction on return then they wil actually listen as the Booking was made from the UK our rules apply regardless of the lack of clarity on the Airasia site so I will update the outcome, for me its not about the £20 its more about the priciple now so fight on ;)\n",

      "Just saw this from FlyerTalk and the SFO website - \"San Francisco International Airport (SFO) will conduct a series of temporary runway closures during 2013 to accomplish construction activity for federally-mandated Runway Safety Areas. These closures will primarily consist of weekend closures of either Runway 28L or 28R, which are the primary runways for arriving flights. Only one runway will be closed at any given time. During closures, the arrival rate at SFO will be reduced from 60 aircraft per hour to 30 aircraft per hour. Delays for flights originating within a two-hour radius of SFO are expected to occur during peak travel times. Peak times are between 9:00 a.m. to12:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Travelers are strongly encouraged to contact their respective carriers regarding any potential delays.\" flysfo.com/web/…updates The dates listed are ... Jan. 11-14, Jan. 18-21, Jan. 25-28, April 5-8, April 12-15, April 19-22, April 26-29 , June 25-26 and and June 27-28 . Runways 28-L and 28-R are used for long haul takeoffs and for virtually all landings. The important point to note is that flights to SFO originating at an airport within a 2 hour flying time, will be subject to delays. These airports cover most of the west coast, from San Diego (SAN) in the south to Portland (PDX - my home) in the north. Seattle is a 2hr15 flight from SFO, so may not be immune. These delays already happen when bad weather hits SFO, as flights from nearby airports are subject to flow control. Should bad weather and these closures hit on the same day(s) it could be big time problems. If you have a flight to SFO and an onward connection for these dates, as referenced above you'd be advised to contact your airline. If you're planning on connecting via SFO from a nearby airport on these dates, allow an enormous amount of contingency, and even consider avoiding SFO altogether.\n",

      "This is a terrible, fraudulent company that luers people in through cheap airline tickets. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. My partner and I bought two business class tickets to Belize from San Fransisco and discovered a week later that there were unauthorized charges on our credit card that added up to almost double of the original cost of the tickets. Not only did they try to double charge us but then changed our tickets to coach class on the returning flight. We've been hassling with them for a week to get these issues resolved and so far only one ticket has been changed and only half of the money they owed us has been paid back. After looking this company (aka Solar Tours, Cheapticketabroad.com, etc..) on the BBB website and reading other posts about these companies, we know we are not the only ones who have been scammed. The BBB gives them an F rating. They've had to change their name several times to try and hide the fact that they are a shady company. Doesn't get any worse than that. Does any one have more information or a contact number for this company?

EVery flight out of our city was cancelled. Not my fault. Not Aeromexico's fault. These things happen. So, I called them to see how they were going to handle it. They said a refund was not an option. Fine. Act of God, whatever. So they said they would rebook my flight at a different date but they were sold out until the end of the month. And oh, by the way, I would have to pay the difference between the original ticket price and they ticket price of a different date----which was $500 more than the original ticket price, because the only tickets they had available were during the high season. I think that's poor customer service, but okay. Fine. The guy said I had 10 months to redeem it. Well, I called back three weeks later to rebook it, and he said that I only had two days to rebook the flight, that time had passed, they were taking my money and they would not be giving it back. NO ONE told me this when I talked to them originally. They made it very clear I had up to ten months to rebook it at no charge except for any difference in the ticket price. I explained this and asked to speak to a manager or supervisor. The guy on the phone was *extremely* rude though I was trying to stay calm and cordial with him. I asked 4 times before he finally agreed to let me speak to a supervisor. At which time, he put me on hold and left me there for 45 minutes. Finally, I hung up and called back. The same jerk answered the phone. I tried asking to speak to a supervisor again, and he hung up on me. What. The hell. Do NOT book through Aeromexico for any reason.

      "I wanted to pass on my experience to travelers trying to get a passport in under 3 weeks from travel date. I was caught in the Oh s$#% time frame of under 3 weeks and over 2 weeks so I could not make appointment at the Miami passport agency . I scrambled 2 and 1/2 weeks till travel date what should I do? I panicked, I read horror stories and read great stories online. What should I do I ask my self. Wait 1/2 a weeks to make a appointment and hope I can get one before my travel date. One of the passport agency worker actually in a way suggested I should wait and set a appointment. I was scared its almost june summer is here its travel season. If I wait I risk not getting appointment in time. Three phone calls to the passport agency and I get a old man Nice calming voice in my state of panic telling me to expediate it. At the time expediated was 2-3 weeks and the clerk at courts said its the 3 week mark. The passport agent told me do it, my response was what if I don't get it in time he stated \" I had a get out of jail free card.\" At 4 days prior to departure if the application is good I can request a emergancey appointment with the Miami agency.. This gave me the kick in the but to expediate it and the relief I had a back up plan.. I herd rumors that the passport agency is the only functional branch of government now I can say confidently that these people are efficient. It only took 7 days, thats right 7 days not business days but days to get it to my door. I right this so the people who are stuck on the fence at the 2-3 week mark and are scared, don't be scared. The passport agency will do what ever they can not to delay you. Suggestions don't forget to put travel date and send it threw clerk of courts or accepted post offices. These certified places make it alittle quicker than you just sending it, Best of Luck and I hope this helps someone in the same situation I was in. _=) Edited: 8:16 pm, May 28, 2016\n",

      "United decided to not go along with its plan to end complimentary hot meals in economy on some international flights. Hot meals will be included on all Trans-Atlantic and Pacifc international flights again from all UA airports in all classes. Here is the email: Dear Mr.(snip), Thank you for your direct, candid feedback on the test we had planned to launch in the fourth quarter for food choices on some of our flights. We heard you and have decided not to move forward with the test of offering customers buy-on-board options in United Economy on certain trans-Atlantic flights. We will continue to offer complimentary hot meals on those flights. The response from you and many of our corporate customers, even before we launched the test, told us what we would have undoubtedly learned had we proceeded - you value our hot meal service in economy class for international flights. In this environment, where higher costs driven by volatile fuel prices are now the norm, we must continue to tailor products and services so that we provide you with choices and competitive fares. As such, we will continue to be proactive in testing new ideas. On October 1, we will proceed with the test of new, complimentary options for United Business customers on three-cabin aircraft used for domestic routes, which represents 16 daily flights. Customers on these flights will receive complimentary fresh sandwiches, salads, breakfast, snack boxes or snacks, depending on the length of flight and time of departure. They will also continue to enjoy complimentary beverages, including beer, wine and cocktails. We will evaluate the results and determine next steps by the end of the year. It's also important to note that full meals will still be served on our p.s. transcontinental flights. Thank you again for your feedback. We will continue to listen and make changes that enable us in this environment to provide you with the choices you value. Sincerely, Graham Atkinson Chief Customer Officer\n",

      "Hi, An interesting article today from USA today's travel section-- which is essentially an encapsulation of a larger, more detailed article written by the Wall Street Journal-- that discusses historical airfares and what people pay today as compared to 1995 levels. While I've mentioned this before, I thought the article was interesting for two reasons.. First, it does confirm what I suspect most people know to be reality.. that being the **average** air fare paid today is in fact LOWER than what you paid **on average** back in 1995 when adjusted for inflation.. Again, this is an average and applies to only US carriers.. but I do think that it applies to most markets-- some more than others, but most markets.. But the more interesting thing that the WSJ author notes-- is that even when you add in checked bag fees and other fees that didn't exist as separate charges back in 1995 (the WSJ author quotes a figure of $21.66 for these fees in total) it's STILL cheaper.. 16% cheaper with the fees added into the comparison, 21% without the fees added..

      "Here is the description of my terrible experience with FlightNetwork: I needed to book round trip tickets to Copenhagen for 3 people. We searched Google flights for the best deal and found a round trip flight for $843 from Flight Network. Since we needed to book using 3 different credit cards, I called FlightNetwork for the booking to ensure that we all get the same price and availability. First, it takes the agent forever to find the flight I am talking about (even using the flight numbers). Then, the agent tells me that the price I am seeing is due to a “glitch” in the system but they would honour this price. I am put on hold for long periods of time in order for the agent to come to this conclusion. It is already 30 minutes that I’m on the call and I have no new information other than the information I already had accessed online in less than 2 minutes. I tell the agent I would like to book with 3 credit cards and apply a promo code (for $20 discount per booking). The agent then asks me for the credit card numbers. Without asking me for my promo code, she has already applied a random promo code that gives $10 discount. I was frustrated at the incompetence of the agent and the long wait times so I decided I would continue the transaction online. I hang up with the agent, go through the online booking system, put in my credit card, click on “Purchase Now”, only to get a pop up that says the online system could not confirm my fare. I refresh the page and suddenly the flight is showing up at $896. I call back 5 minutes after I’ve hung up with the agent the first time, and she tells me that flight prices have gone up. I now decide to proceed with the booking anyway as it is urgent enough for me to book this flight. Another 45 minutes goes by, again long hold times, and my 3 flights are now booked. I receive emails with details of the booking but no invoice. I told myself I would call the next day to ask about the invoice. The next day, I notice the flight is showing at $843 again! And, on top of that, when I log in to the Air Canada website to manage my booking, the purchase price is actually at $843. So when I call back FlightNetwork, I tell them about this and I also tell them that I can’t even confirm what has been charged because I never received an invoice. Again, more ridiculously long hold times - every time, I ask a question, the agent tells me to hold on, puts me on hold for 5-10 minutes and comes back throwing up an answer she received from someone else. What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question. Initially, the agent tells me that she says I was charged $843 mistakenly. I am so confused. Then, she comes back and says oh no, it was $896 that you were charged. Complete chaos!! She sends me the invoice which says that I am paying $285 for the flight and $611.57 in taxes totalling $896.57. Then I tell her that the flight is back to $843 on their website. She says she cannot see this price in their database. I am literally refreshing the page as I speak to the agent and am seeing $843. I had to send a screenshot of what I am seeing on their website to them to prove that I am seeing this price!! She then says that because the flight is book, she cannot refund the difference but can provide it as a credit due to their price drop protection. I was not satisfied with this but looked like I didn’t have another option so I agree and she tells me that it will appear in my account within 3-5 business days. It has been 4 and still nothing but we will see. During the call, I ask to speak with a supervisor and she tells me that the supervisor will basically tell me the same thing… The total time for this call was 1 hour. Then I finally see the charge on my credit card - I see 2 charges. One with the description AIR CANADA totalling $843 and another with description TASF totalling $53. I google TASF and find out this mean travel agent service fee. I am so furious now as they never informed me that this was part of the price they quoted to me!! It is not even detailed in the invoice. I tried calling and the agent tells me that this doesn’t need to be detailed to me, it is part of the total price but I am still not convinced. This is only $53 but the principle of the matter, I was not informed of the details of the charges to my credit card, let alone the absolutely horrible service, I am sure this is in violation of some consumer protection act or travel agents act. Overall absolutely terrible terrible nightmarish experience with FlightNetwork. Not worth the headache and lack of transparency. Embarrassing that this is a Canadian company.\n",

      "I thought I would share our experience. If you have any questions, please ask. Thomson Flight Booking: Easily done online with no problems. We booked extra legroom seats and we felt the cost was worth it. Seat Selection: This was done online as well and it was simple. My only complaint is that we wanted two aisle seats and it wouldn't let me. Online Check in: I checked in a week ahead of time and printed boarding passes. Again, simple and easy. Night before luggage drop: We dropped off our luggage the night before with no stress or problems. I love being able to do this. Flight: Boarding was on time and very efficient. We did take off about 20 minutes later than planned. The flight was comfortable. We had bought a Boots Meal deal at the airport before we went to the plan. So, we did not purchase anything on the plane. We booked extra space seats and they were good value for my tall husband. The flight is about 3 hours from Manchester. Luggage & Immigration in Naples: we disembarked quickly upon landing to a bus. At immigration, the lines went quickly. We had a little wait for the luggage and then off to our transfer. From landing to our transport heading to Sorrento, it took about 1 1/2 hours. The return trip was just as simple and easy. We were pleased with our flights and now look forward to our trip on the Dreamliner this summer.\n",

Although I certainly understand Boise (or as I call it, Spudville!) is NOT a travel hub of any sort, it just shouldn't be this complicated to buy a ticket online, without involving a travel agent! In looking at Korean Air, Cathay Pacific, etc--one cannot \"start\" from Boise, even though they are partners with airlines that do fly into Boise. I really don't want to travel on two separate tickets. I have also tried Matrix--which is usually very helpful in finding a good \"routing\" and price from Spudville. In the past I've found my itinerary, then just gone to the airline website to purchase the ticket. Worked like a charm for last two trips to Europe! With Bangkok, this isn't working--the fares are MUCH higher on the airlines websites than Matrix, and I can't enter Boise as a starting point. I'm looking at traveling mid January 2012 for about 4 weeks. Flying into and out of BKK is fine. Any suggestions or help is much appreciated! Thanks!\n",

      "We just booked a trip with Sunwing to Mexico over the Christmas holidays and although the property was nice, the flight there and back was a nightmare. We signed up for trip alerts and didn't receive any but one that said they were ontime. Instead they were 4 hours late leaving Toronto and did not notify or communicate this to anyone until 15 minutes before when we were supposed to board. They made us wait for over an hour for a voucher for Lunch and then we got $5, which doesn't buy much more than a coffee at Pearson International. We paid for Premium seats because we had heard the seats were tight and then ours seats were double booked. We were worried about lost bags and went with carry on. When we arrived there were people that had lost luggage, I felt especiaily sad for this young teenage girl who was in tears on the bus ride to the resort. Coming home was no better. Web check in wasn't even offered on the way back Delays again coming home and the sign at the gate continued to read on time, even though they were not. They forced us to check our bags or pay several hundred dollars to carry them on even though we had less then when we went down and the bags were standard carry size for any other airline. We arrived so late that we had to pay for a hotel stay at the airport when we got back. On the 7.5 hour flight down we had one drink service that happened 3.5 hours after we boarded.

      "Since Usairways merger with American our service and prices have suffered out of Charlotte. My last experience made me vow to never fly them unless I absolutely had to. My wife and I just returned from a round trip via Delta from Charlotte to Jacksonville, FL. We flew first class cheaper than a coach seat on AA. From the moment we stepped up to the ticket counter in Charlotte until we got our baggage back at the end of the trip, it was amazing to experience the difference in service. The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing. Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat, fresh blankets, pillows, and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground, and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles. Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings. The entire crew was dressed very sharply, smiled, and actually thanked us for flying with them. They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service. Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crews....it is common place on AA. It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable. On each leg of the trip, our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim. AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutes. Best decision we've made to switch our business to Delta.\n",

The inflight service on the flight from JFK (772-200LR) was pleasant and seats were comfortable and were flat for sleeping. The airline's grounds services at JFK is not efficient for a large group. There were no Pre-Boarding areas for Executive or Business classes at the gate. The ground servive at BLR was also very inefficient and transit service at BOM was HORRIBLE. The flight from BOM to EWR on 747 was acceptable with good inflight food service, but non-existent entertainment and the seats were not flat. The transit at Heathrow (a refueling and more passengers stop) was the most miserable experience in all our flying years....We would not recommend to anyone flying through Heathrow as transit passengers. Their security staff is rude and there is no concept of organized boarding at Heathrow. Incidentally, there is barely enough time to exit the plane with all your belongings, go through security and make it back to the gate before the plane is supposed to leave.

The problem is that I've asked this question 3 times with 3 different telephone reps at Travel Guard Insurance and I've gotten 3 different answers. I don't think the telephone reps understand this either. My question is this: When buying the policy, you have to put down on the application \"trip cost.\" Using BA Avios points for a Business Class ticket, the taxes and fees which I paid were about $1100. (OUCH !!!) The first agent told me to insure the cost of the actual ticket. (I knew this wasn't correct so I called back.) The second agent told me I could only list the cost to re-deposit the points in case of cancellation. This would be $65 USD. I wanted to double-check, so I called back a 3rd time, and the 3rd agent told me to put down the cost of the taxes and fees. In case of cancellation, I would get the taxes and fees back from BA.

We've never used travel insurance because except on one occasion we've always booked our own flights, hotels, trains, etc. That said - I've noticed a number of posts on this and other boards gently chiding people who've encountered problems in their travels for not purchasing trip insurance policies. This has gotten me thinking that maybe we've just been lucky all these years. Last year, we were in the Benelux countries during the volcano eruption. Our luck held, as the no-fly ban was lifted on the day we left (in fact, our booked tix were on the first UAL flight allowed out of Brussels).

I had purchased tickets for my wife, daughter, and myself online with no problems. Upon arrival at Zacatecas (ZCL) for our flight to Chicago Midway (MDW), they said \"the system\" wouldn't let them check her in because she's two years old (despite the obvious fact to the contrary according to her Mexican *and* US passports). They couldn't get \"el sistema\" to let them issue a boarding pass because we were within the month that she turned two (she was 1 year, 11 months). They gave us the ultimatum: buy a full price ticket or don't fly. Not wanting to miss Thanksgiving dinner, we caved. But, as they were trying to buy the ticket for her as an adult \"el sistema\" wouldn't let them because she was not yet two years old!!! They eventually lied, entered an older age, and gave us the Customer Service number and email address for a refund. Essentially the *same* thing happened on the return flight... except this time they said they had absolutely no record of her ticket and forced us to buy another one. Naturally, customer service at Volaris is a joke in English or Spanish. In Spanish, they'll talk down to you, tell you it was your fault, and stonewall you. They'll refuse to let you speak to a supervisor. In English, they'll sound very nice and helpful and then do nothing, saying they'll call you back after checking with the airport for more details. Surprise, surprise, they never call back. If you then call them back, the supervisor (if you're lucky enough to get one... usually the reps just refuse to connect you) will not take your call, leaving you on hold for hours. If you hang up and work your way through Customer Service to the same supervisor... he'll tell his reps to tell you \"he'll call you right back.\" Two months later, and many, many hours on the phone, still no refund. Next stop PROFECO? Anyone else have this problem? What's the next move (besides obviously never flying with them again and advising everyone I know to do the same)?\n",

      "Hi, has anyone had any problems with HMPO online form when submiting their passport application? I applied for my first adult passport in July/2014 by using the online form available. Approximately six weeks later I received a letter saying I needed to complete a whole new form, this time in paper form. I contacted HMPO and asked why, since my application was complete and with no errors. They told me it was because I had missed Section 4 (details on parents). I went back into the online form, this time taking screen shots with date and time, and surprise, surprise there was no Section 4 in the online version of the form. I was never given the opportunity to write my parents details. I repeated the process several times in different dates and managed to get to the end of the form (screen to complete payment and submit). I tried contacting them by phone, but they insisted that despite the problem I had to go through the whole process again. I tried complaining, had no replies. Phoned again several times, then they finally said they could not find my application, then later on they \"found\" it but that there was no way around it. As a result I have waited for my passport to be processed for more than 8 weeks now - and still no idea when it will be finalised. I read in a similar trip advisor forum (\"Problems with the Passport Office,dated April 2014) that some people, Miss B and Nanny503927 for example, were having similar problems. I would not recommend use of HMPO online form for new applicants... And i was wondering if anyone has had similar issues. Thank you\n",

I booked some flights and elected to pay by Direct Deposit to avoid the credit card surcharge. As my bank is the same as theirs the transaction was processed immediately. Two working days later when I checked my itinerary, it was flagged as pending, unpaid. As when I had originally made the payment it said that the booking would only be held for two days I was a little concerned and phoned their customer service department. When I eventually got through, after some discussion I was asked to send a copy of my bank's confirmation of payment, which I duly did. Later that day I found the itinerary was now marked as paid so I was happy enough with that. However, this morning a Jetstar rep called me to check that everything was now OK and ask if I had received my itinerary (which I had). Not only that, but she had to call four times before I was available to take the call, which I thought was pretty good follow up, I would have thought they'd give up after the second try. They did leave voice mail, but only to say they wanted to speak with me personally, so they also didn't take that out and call it good. I was impressed, better service than I expected.\n",

      "I have not flown internationally in a long time....or even domestically since the invention of the TSA. I therefore had some trepidation about the flight, figuring it would be a royal PITA, no food, and generally where the end would justify the means. Wrong. I chose British Airways Open Skies from Newark to Orly because I had always had good experiences with BA. Also, I liked the idea of a smaller plane with less people. It seemed to be a bit more civilized. I was not disappointed even though we traveled economy. The seats were leather and comfy, and not quite as narrow as some. Our seats were the first row in economy, so although not separated by a wall, there was a lot of leg space between our seats and the last row of business class. We were not treated as if we were the inferior class. We received iPads, a full meal which was quite good, as well as a small breakfast snack before landing...all at no additional cost. Upon the return we were two in three seats, which was terrific. We had a sizable snack, a full meal which was also quite good and another snack prior to landing. The flight crew (captain et al) on both flights were terrific....informative and very personable. The flight attendants were very pleasant, professional and helpful...and love the uniforms as they have a chic retro vibe. Along with the pillow and blanket we received a packet with eye shades, socks, and another item I can't recall. Boarding and disembarking were both a breeze although upon Orly arrival we did not have jetway access but had to disembark on the airfield where a bus waited to take us to the terminal. On the return to Newark we hit a wind shear upon touch down which the female pilot handled very admirably. Luggage retrieval was painless...again, due to far fewer passengers. One point...the 757-200 is a narrow body jet. Therefore the aisles are narrower than many other types of aircraft. Therefore, any bump in the air will cause you to bump the passenger in the seat if walking in the aisle, or be bumped if you are seated. Other than that, the flight was like flying used to be, when passengers were treated like humans, and not cattle. IMO, all,others airlines should,take a page out of the BAOS book. I would fly them again in a heartbeat. Now all they need to add is in flight WiFi, and the service would be perfect.\n",

I want to make sure you know I'm not one of those people. When booking my trip I did request assistance from Allegiant with my luggage, moving through the airport and security, to the gate, and on and off the plane. I tried to be as specific as possible as to the assistance I needed since I was traveling alone. These requests were not out of line and should have all been provided by Allegiant. Instead, Allegiant asked my family member who was dropping me off at the airport to help me to my gate which was a huge inconvieniece for them. On my first leg the gate was changed before the flight and another passenger had to move me to the new gate. But that was nothing compared to how I found my wheelchair every time I received it back from Allegiant after landing. After the first leg, the left arm rest was broken off. I didn't say anything at that time thinking that it was just a \"things happen\" situation. I really lost it though when at the end of my second leg, as I was being wheeled down the ramp, the young man who was wheeling me down wheeled my left wheel partially on the edge of the ramp causing the rubber tire to come off my wheel!! Then he started telling me how it was \"normal wear and tear\". REALLY?!?! When my husband and I got back to our car we inspected the chair closer and found that the edge of the back of the chair had a rip in the vinyl!! It's going to cost me more to repair this chair than it will to just replace it. What makes me so angry is that no one says sorry. My husband worked for an entire day to make this chair fit my personality by painting it sparkly hot pink since I have to spend so much time in it. Now though, I'm house bound because they just didn't care to take care of something that is so important to me. I did contact them, I guess they have 30 days to respond.\n",

And, significantly, the zips went on both of them. So we needed new cases, we wanted strong hard shell weatherproof ones (having seen what happens to soft cases left out in the rain......) and, most importantly, no zips. And we found them ! American Tourister \"Flite\" (Samsonite`s budget range). They`re not the lightest in the world but built like tanks, plastic tanks I grant you, but tanks none the less. You`ll always see loads of them owned by seasoned travellers on airport luggage carousels. They came with a 3 year guarantee, but 4 years later after loads of hard use we needed a spare part for one, it just screwed on and they just put it in the post, for free ! That level of customer service is rare indeed these days. Anyway, earlier this year a friend of mine wanted my advice on what suitcase to buy. I`ve seldom been so certain of any recommendation, buy the American Tourister hard shell suitcases we bought back in 2009, but guess what ? Yes you`re right ! They don`t do them anymore ! In fact they don`t do anything similar and neither does anyone else (well Samsonite do one model, but that was a bit out of her price range). The question is why are all suitcases on the market these days flimsy soft and zipped ? ! ? Edited: 4:15 pm, September 20, 2012\n",

Prior to take off in Perth we were joined in the row in front of us by 3 drunk men who from that moment on set about drinking the cabin dry. After an hour, the one in front of my wife suddenly decided to put his seat into a full recline position hitting my wife in the face. We complained and verbal hostilities arose. We were moved 5 rows back. This was not the end of our troubles. From that point onwards we were threatened contiunally by these men. This was pointed out to the crew. Approaching to land I was told by \"the leader\" that they would be waiting for me in the corridor. This was heard by a Stewardess. A terrifying experience all round. Nothing happened in the corridor but we were on edge continually. Luckily for us, they did not continue on our joining flight to Heathrow. I emailed a complaint to Malaysia Airways and 4 weeks later they have replied sending a 3 line email back saying thanks for my observations and they will review their practices on future flights. The questions is. Do I now leave it at that or is that the best I can expect from a 5 star airline ?????\n",

      "Just a heads up for my fellow TripAdvisior travelers: Delta \"Partners\" with Alitalia out of Rome. First off, FCO is a terrible airport to travel to/from or through. They are always packed with too few staff (counters & \"TSA\" checkpoints), the flights NEVER take off on time, you can't understand the PA system and a Coke costs 6 Euros. And, I have a problem every time I use Alitalia. They are famous for switching your seats if they have an Alitalia frequent flyer book after you who asks for your seats. They always give first priority to their own frequent flyers. It's happened to me three times now (most recently 9/14), so they still do it. You can go ahead book through Delta, but make sure that it's a Delta flight on Delta equipment. Otherwise, you're taking your chances. These forums are valuable only if you post recent and useful info. If you have a good experience; post it. If it's bad, such as mine; post it as well. Good luck.\n",

Of course there are other airlines that you can use but if you are want to use Virgin ( as we always do) don't hang around or you may be disappointed.\n",

      "First of all - let me say - I know baggage allowances exist for good reason - and that we should abide by them - This post is not about that - its about how in certain situations staff really make it hard for customers to like a brand. I was flying Ork-Birmigham on an ATR72 (double prop plane with limited overhead baggage space). I fly this route relatively often - and as often as not hand luggage is take from you and put in the hold. Also - as often as not this plane runs at least 30 minutes late. So I arrive in Cork and would prefer not to have to have bags checked - but they are as its a pretty full flight. C'est la Vie. The flight leaves late due to late inbound craft -(which is a BS excuse really - - a more honest one would be the craft was late because its on an end to end schedule with very tight turnaround times, and we stuffed up somewhere earlier in the day) So I land an hour late and then have to wait for my bags - C'est la vie. On my return leg - I decide to ask at check in should I check my bag - I get advised that if I do there will be a charge (at least 50% of the time that i fly this route I am forced to check it - which of course is free - but I prefer not having to check it). I inform the staff member (Ms Ragdish) that i have no desire to check it, but will it be taken off me. She asks me to present it for weighing - and as it weighs 11KG she says I must pay 40£ to check it. I offered to take something out but she stated that then my laptop case would be over weight. So I had to pay 40£ to have a suitcase taken off me that would have been taken off me anyway. I only offered as having flown the route many times I wanted to assist on making things run smoother. And this was how I was repayed What a lousy customer loyalty reward. Then the PLane ran 75 minutes late. Michael O'Leary from Ryan Air decided a year and a half ago that it wasnt a good idea to muck about as much on luggage restrictions - and moved away from it in favour of better customer services. Aer lingus have apparently decided to try and see if they can make that failed policy work. Can I ask the question of Aer Lingus - If you try to emulate his failed baggage policy, could I implore you to try and at least aim for his successful on time policy? (soap box dismantled)\n",

      "This is not an airline I thought I would ever use. However, I booked a short break and only at the end of the booking did the lady mention it was a Ryanair flight. (Thanks to those of you on this forum that pointed out Ryanair don’t actually permit this; thankfully we were fine). I spent forever obsessing about my hand luggage and in the end opted to take only a rucksack – was only staying 3 nights. As soon as I arrived at the airport I headed straight to their bag measurers to ensure it was the right size. Turns out it could have been double the size and it would still have been okay. However, I needn’t have bothered because no one checked the size or weight of the bag before boarding either of the flights. In fact, as far as I could see no one on either of our flights had their bags checked. I did wonder though if this was because of flight was running late because as we were queuing to board we could see people departing the plane. Funnily enough we taxied right on time and for the return flight we left about 10 minutes late. I spent ages entering the online check in details as there’s a charge for entering information incorrectly. Again, I needn’t have bothered as the guy barely glanced my passport as he tore my boarding pass. When we did get onboard there did seem to be a problem with some people’s luggage as there wasn’t room overhead for everything but they managed to squeeze cases under some people’s seat. The plane seemed clean as far as I could see and the seats were comfy. Only criticism was that the seats did not recline nor were there any pockets on the back of the seat in front of you to store newspapers etc. I didn’t purchase any drinks or snacks as I took my own on board. And the little interaction I had with staff was pleasant enough. Another slightly annoying things was that my mum, who travels on a Barbados passport, had to have her boarding pass stamped before departure or she’s refused boarding. They make this very clear for the departure flight but I didn’t think it was necessary for the return flight. Praise God I decided to check to be on the safe side because it turns out it needs to be stamped in both directions. So, the nightmares I had in the lead up to the flight were unfounded. However, there was a couple at our hotel who flew out on another Ryanair flight and were charged the £40 for being a kilo over weight. To me it begged the question of whether there was something they could have thrown away and purchased once they landed but hey. Would I fly Ryanair again? Probably not of my choosing but if I absolutely had to then I guess I would as long as I was careful to follow all their rules.\n",

      "Just wanted to relieve some of the anxiety for those of you who have booked flights with Globespan and heard the horror stories. I was very apprehensive and expecting some delays, but everything was fine. We flew out of the Hamilton, Ontario, terminal and it was great! So compact, no walking, just park the car, walk in, check in, and on the plane. Wonderful compared to Pearson. Arrived in Dublin, Ireland on time. Flight over was in an older aircraft purchased from an Icelandic airline. We bought economy no frills and it was pretty tight for leg room. If you have long legs, spring for the premier. Other than that, it was just fine - plane left and arrived on time. On the flight home, we got a \"free\" meal and non alcoholic drinks, even though it said on the website you needed to preorder the meals. The people that preordered got a different meal (beef or pasta dish). We got a type of chili with vegetables and a bun with a dessert. Can't say every flight will go as smoothly, but I hope this will help with some of the apprehension involved with this airline.\n",

      "Feb 2nd, 2008 I was at Newark/Liberty airport to pick up a puppy that was being sent to me from a breeder in Texas. Unfortunately this breeder used American Airlines to transport the dog. I had used the useless flight tracker to get updated on the status of flight 558 and tracked the \"Airway Bill/Confirmation number\" to track as well. I called American Airlines Cargo prior to going to the airport. The flight was scheduled to arrive early and I took my family to the airport to pick up our new dog. After waiting for well over two hours after the flight landed, the people representing American Airlines Cargo could not give any information other than \"we don't know where the dog is, there were no dogs on flight 558\". They offered NO direction or help other than asking people to leave the carge office. In fact all four people behind the counter disappeared into a side \"break room\" with a poor attitude and suggessted we call in a few hours to see if the \"packages\" were found. Disgraceful. There were 11 families waiting and as this dragged on with absolutely no communication there was obviously frustration. The solution for the American Airlines employees was to call the airport security. These were families with children waiting and this was an absurd way to handle the situation. I called the breeder who could not get any information. I called American Airlines twice from my cell phone, only to be told that the dog in fact was at Newark airport as the flight had landed with the dog was on it. Not true but this was the only information available. Clearly no one knew what was going on and there is a serious flaw in their tracking capabilities. The fact that an error was made was not the issue. The complete inability of anyone representing AA at the airport or on the phone to address the situation was beyond irresponsible. The people in the cargo office were rude, unprofessional and dismissive. In fact, as we waited there were people from other flights coming to claim pets that were also lost because American Airlines never bothered to put them on the flight. AA systems are dangerously flawed. The employees are incompetenent, don't care and the airline is incapable of being trusted to transport an animal, child or anything of value. These puppies and family pets were left unattended in small crates for an unhealthy amount of time, neglected by American Airlines. They truly think of animals as nothing more than cargo and have zero concern for the health and well being of any animal they are transporting. If they can not responsibly transport a dog, YOU are not safe on this Airline. They have obviously stopped caring at all and should do us all a favor by declaring bancruptcy and get out of a business that has clearly passed them by.\n",

      "The topic of airfare price drops has been done to death I guess but I'll give it another whack. Is Air Canada the worst offender? I am not an experienced air traveller but I was very surprised to find the airfare for the same flights I booked in early February from Australia to Vancouver return (Sep/Oct travel) have dropped by 25% six weeks later! I booked the cheapest fare (economy tango) for my family on our first international trip and I chose Air Canada because it is a direct flight and we have limited time during school holidays. The airlines seem to know when it is holiday time and bump up the prices. I have to say 25% is a significant price drop for the same class seats on the same flights. I am disappointed at losing $2000 and it is an unfortunate lesson. If I could afford the higher fares I gather the tickets would be refundable and I would not lose out, except for the nasty cancellation fee. My tickets are not refundable and I am informed there is no option to rebook at the new lower fare. I wouldn't mind so much if the price drop wasn't so large. If this is a normal occurrence it seems booking with Air Canada is like spending money on a lottery ticket.\n",

      "My family and I booked 4 tickets to New York for a week long stay, a week cruise, and then reurn home. Given that the day the ship returns to port, we will also have to fly back home, I called British Airways and asked in the slim possibility that Internet will not be avaialble on board the ship (distance, technical problems etc) what can be done if anything to ensure that all 4 family members can be together for the long flight back home. It is a very remote possibility that Internet will not be available on board the ship, but who knows.... I just wanted to make sure that we do not have any unplesant surprises. To my dismay they said that airport check-in is possible but do not guarantee that we will all be seated together. They asked for a total of 200EUR to preallocate the seats. I would expect this from a low-cost budget airline but certainly not from BA. I did not ask for a ticket change or any other upgrade or service (like extra luggage or preferential seating) I should pay for, but paying 5000EUR for 4 tickets and then being asked for another 200EUR for the simplest of service, it really bothers me. In my opinion this is a \"nickel and dime\" practice at best. I wrote them an email about it, and they did NOT even respond to it. I would at least expect a typical answer from them. Are my expectations unreasonable (do not overcharge for services, replay to complaint emails)???? Thank you all, Andreas\n",

I'll try to keep this brief. Phx-PHL leg uneventful. Got to PHL and checked in at gate and big problem. They had to downsize the aircraft from a 767 to a 757 and were asking volunteers to give up seats. I had a HUGE event plannd in London next night I could not give my seat up. Finally they had enough volunteers and they tried to split me and my freind up. I said no way she is elderly and can barely walk and needs assistance with everything so they put us back together. Got to LHR safely. Had great trip. Flight back..huge overbook and again asking for volunteers, at least no aircraft downgrade. Left almost on time, not 1 seat to spare. Got to PHL and sat on runway for almost an hour no open gates. I had to reclaim my bag, go through security again, ran with my carryon and laptop to the gate and missed the jet by 5 minutes. I had to stay the night without any of my bags they had already been checked. No clean clothes, nothing. All toiletries sitting in Phx. Got small care package from airline with toothbrush, shampoo thats it. Cell phone dead because charger in suitcase.

      "Leaving in 3 weeks for a 14 day cruise with 3 day extensions before and after cruise--so about 3 weeks total. Flying from San Diego (commuter plane) to LAX where we fly British Air to Heathrow and then into Stockholm. Hope to pack in just carry on, not because we don't want to pay for luggage, but because on our last trip, through Heathrow, British Air lost our checked bag(s) in BOTH directions. The carry on suitcase, that I have used successfully in the past, is the 22\" from Costco with 2 wheels only. I did carry it on a year and a half ago on British Air without any problem. Also, it did fit into the sizing frame on an American Air domestic flight this past May, when the LAX porter said \"that bag is too big for a carry on!\" but I am concerned about whether British Air has a new size restriction for carry on bags. The bag measures 23\" from wheels to top, even though it is sold as a 22\". If we are going to have to check this bag after arrival at the airport, I might as well pack in a large bag and not have to worry about what I pack. What are your thoughts?\n",

On one occasion I was travelling with my wedding dress and I emailed ahead just to ask how they would advise I carry it.

When they asked us for our passenger information we provided them with the correct information regarding first and last names. However, when they sent our itinerary, my first name was misspelled. I usually write my name as 'Luuk', while my passport says 'Lucas'. I remember signing emails with Luuk, yet I also know that I gave the correct passport names when asked. When I was at Heathrow airport I first encountered that the name on my ticket didnt match my passport. At that point it wasn't to big a deal, but I got to fly anyway. I tried to change my name at the AIR New Zealand service desk, but they couldnt do it and said that the travel agent had to do it. I'm currently in Australia after stopping over in Hong Kong. I could make all flights with the wrong name, even if that sometimes led to skewed faces. I've contacted the travel agent (Travel Nation) and asked them if they could change my name, since I provided them with the correct names. They told me it couldnt be done, since I already started travelling. Instead the added a note, stating that my first name was misspelled. In the accompanying email (in which my first name was misspelled again as Luuc!!!!!) they stated that 'this is not a guarantee for the USA'. So now I'm getting a bit freaked. I'm sure that I will be able to fly to all my other destinations, but If I cant fly to the US, that would be awfull. Is there nothing that can be done?\n",

I have read reviews where members seem to have a pompous attitude to dress code and snub any form of casual sports wear. My son looks very respectable in his fashion wear and is clean and tidy. I have worked in office environments where business men dressed in suits are offensive due to their uncleanliness but because it is a suit and looks business it is deemed. Dress code is surely subjective for an airport lounge where people are meant to be in holiday mode! Shouldn't the fact that a person is be clean and tidy and respectful be more important than what line of attire they are wearing? I totally agree that a person should dress respectful in terms of not revealing too much flesh but reasonable length shorts and trainers...what is the problem? Maybe there should be a business lounge purely for business attire and an exclusive lounge for respectful people who can wear any fashion provided they are clean, tidy and respectful to others.\n",

      "Just want to give others a heads up that Cheap Caribbean/Apple Group is a company with horrible business practices as well as customer support. Be very aware that when you click on accepting the terms of use this company will not compensate you for any errors they have made. Our experience is a result of this company not disclosing on their website they charge in US currency. However, looking through various sites even US based clients have had several issues regarding this company not providing compensation for legitimate complaints. I have sent the following email to the founder of Apple Leisure and the CEO and they refuse to respond. You will also notice the contact info for this company is very vague on their website. In short, we have booked vacations through many on-line companies that are ethical. THis one is not so do not expect any client support from them..... I am writing today to tell you how disappointed I am in your misleading business practices and disgusted I am with your customer support (a common thread in many reviews for your company). I shop on-line a lot and book trips through on-line travel sites so I am knowledgeable on how things work at check-out. I am from Canada and shop in the US, UK and, of course, Canada. We used Cheap Caribbean last year to book a trip and we were charged Canadian funds (funds were at par) and because of this we assumed your company charges us in our currency. There is NOTHING on the website or at checkout to indicate otherwise. For example, even when we book with Hotwire US we are quoted at checkout USD meaning the final price states clearly USD. Cheap Caribbean does not specify anywhere on the website or on our ticket voucher you charge in USD. There is nothing in your contract either to indicate you charge in USD. We were pretty shocked when we were billed $450+ more than we were invoiced for on our credit card. When I called customer care indicating I expect a refund the differance I was informed by a robotic like human ...we are a US company we charge in USD. I could not get Bobby to understand the issue is not that you charge in USD, you don't tell your customers you charge USD. A call to the supervisor was a waste of time. He could care less. The LAST think a customer wants to here is \"we are not doing anything for you\". So, as a result of this I have filed a complaint with the BBB and had several conversations with my friends and coworkers telling them how misleading this company is and all I spoke to are shocked you do not indicate what currency you charge in. Your refusal to pay back what you should not have charged in the first place will cost you a lot of future business. Your lack of action speaks volumes about your business practices (shady) and you lack of interest in customer satisfaction. Also, you may want to have a supervisor train your service reps. When asked ``How are you`the response of `I am okay`is not professional at all. In addition, perhaps educate your staff that a .com company does not indicate you are US based. I work for a Canadian based company with a .com site. Then again, we are ethical and clearly indicate currency charged on our invoices.\n",

Free drinks and good food with extremely pleasant staff. I can't fault this airline for value for money!! I understand they are having a new lounge and check in at Newark in the near future. We had to spend 7 hours there on our way back and as there is no left baggage facility at the airport and the Silverjet lounge didn't open until midday we couldn't get in to NY for the day which was our intention. However, that is hardly Silverjet's fault and as I understand they are shortly starting another flight to NY presumably the check in will be open for more hours. Anyway the lounge was perfectly comfortable, with plenty of food and drinks should one need it. All in all a great experience and we shall certainly never travel to NY any other way.\n",

After speaking with an extremely unhelpful and rude supervisor, and explaining our situation, she said she would investigate further and disappeared, only to return 45 minutes later to again repeat there were no seats for us.

Also, by obtaining the United Mileage Explorer credit card, the primary person gets priority boarding and 2 checked bags free. Their traveling companion will get the same as long as their are on the same reservation. So I can't use my miles to get a ticket seperatelly.

      "Beware what you get with budget airlines ... you probably will get what you pay for --- or in my case less. Flew Spirit Airlines from New York to Myrtle Beach and back last week with my wife and two-year old. Of course with kids (especially with safety seats that have to be in window seat to prevent blocking the egress path) I knew we'd be ponying up a significant chunk of change for baggage charges and pre-paid seat assignments. Flights were delayed, lines were long, ground staff was overworked and, with exception of one nice man, rude ... but figured you get what you pay for. Little did I know, you can actually get less than you paid for --- on the return flight the Spirit Airlines computer system was down in Myrtle Beach --- causing in addition to very long lines (always fun with a 2-year old), the loss of all information on who pre-paid for seats and baggage so it would be open seating. Annoying, but we were informed that all baggage would be free and anyone pre-paying for baggage or seat assignments would get a refund by calling the 1-800 number. Other than asking twice for the 1-800 number and never getting it, we did arrive safely in NY two hours late which is not horrible for LaGuardia. However, upon returning and calling the 1-800 number I was informed that since I did check luggage and did use 3 seats - I would not have any money refunded. So you can get less that what you paid for --- even on a budget airline.\n",

We travelled on LIAT extensively in Jan12 & they were always on time + no probs with baggage; although there was one delayed flight scheduled to leave about the time of ours, so sympathies to those PAXs. Obviously you don't expect or get full service on a short island hop, but it's quite adequate. There may be something in the WI culture (or LIAT training) which doesn't generate an instant but synthetic 'have a nice day' welcome but, if you engage with the staff, my experience was that you receive a warm & informed response. I would recommend them, which is probably just as well because they have a monopoly on many of the intra-Caribbean routes.\n",

      "So Ryanair seem to have pressed the mute button on the Michael O'Sleary remote control. Perhaps realising that pi55ing customers off is perhaps not the best business strategy in the world and that the same joke is just not funny year after year. Not all publicity is good publicity it appears. So they do seem on the face of it to have made some good improvements. They have a new marketing manager, team and it seems strategy. The website has been completely revamped and IMO looks and feels great. The stupid CAPTCHA thing has been removed. Credit & debit card charges have been reduced to a fair (or is that a fare) level.

      "Flying to Orlando from Manchester I booked 2 exit seats to get the extra leg room - row 49, seats J+K. 49 H+J had acres of leg room, but 49K had virtually no leg room! The reason is that the exit door has a huge box in front of it, presumably to store the slide to be used in an emergency. Since this is right in front of seat 49K, there is almost no leg room - it is worse than the normal seats! I complained to the steward, who said that there was nothing he could do but to log it as an incident. Fortunately for us, there was no-one sitting in seat 49H so we used H+J and had a great flight - but it could have been much worse. I have written to VA to get my £35 fee refunded - there is no reason to charge extra to get LESS legroom! Robin\n",

      "Flew yesterday from Manchester to Orlando. Routing was originally via Atlanta with 4 hour layover prior to onward to MCO. 10 pax with reserved seating in economy. All pretty routine. Half of party arrives at MAN and calls me as checking out hotel, Atlanta flight overbooked. Heart sinks as travelling first time where it is just me with three sons, and sons girlfriend. So as I am mentally thinking EU261 rules, this is quickly followed up by they want to know if we are willing to switch to non stop flight leaving 30 minutes later. Heck yes, especially with a PE upgrade thrown in. 747-400 (Barbarella): great IFE, pretty good food (chicken well spicy must have read the tomato juice experiment), excellent attentive service. Seat are good pitch, but for me are not the most comfortable with headrest adjustment poor. Economy on way home is going too be a let down for the kids, hey ho. MCO arrival was excellent. We were an hour from wheels down to driving out the rental car garage. Immigration was empty, used new kiosks which worked for 7 out of 10 including sons girlfriend who had not travelled before. We did go through recheck for 3 as their receipts had a cross on. I know some have reported this process being done twice over, with some work to rule type approach but for me it was only for issues with taking finger scan. Grabbed bags, hit the tram and out. So great experience all round, even saw the Dreamliner at MAN ;-) Now just need to ask an EU261 compensation questions and complain about not getting my assigned seats...\n",

They offered me £30 compensation, it cost me £220 in phone bills trying to get someone to look for them. They actually make money from putting you on hold. I found several auction houses in London that sell off \"lost luggage\" and kept doing a search for records. 4 months later, guess what, they were selling off my records that they claim they could not find. On calling up the auction house, they read out a few titles and that confirmed that they were my records. No they were NOT my records they belonged to BA and there was nothing I could do but bid on them again in the hope that I would win back my own records. The ladies in the auction house were very helpful and I did win back my records for £60. 1.2 million bags were \"irretrievably lost\" by BA in 2007. Shocking really.\n",

When I look it up on Delta's website, it says from the US to Europe you get 1 free checked bag. delta.com/content/… We did actually check 2 bags for one of us and one for the other and were not charged. The people next to us in the bag drop were also checking 2 bags per person. We did pay for Economy Comfort, but that doesn't seem to affect what bags you can check. The only logical reason I can see would be if the UK is not considered part of Europe and falls into the \"For all other international flights\" at the bottom of the chart. Obviously I'm not complaining, but I'd like to understand so I know in the future if we are entitled to 2 bags. Thanks.\n",

      "My boyfriend and I made a trip to Spain(Hong Kong-Madrid and Madrid- Hong Kong). We flied with Aeroflot and had both trips scaling in Moscow. Both going(30th Aug) and coming back(15th Sep), the luggages were spot checked as the suitcase locks were open when we got the luggages back (which we think by Russia Airport Authority as this has never happened since I have transited and been traveling around to any other countries). The going trip to Spain, both suitcase locks were open, broken lock for my boyfriend's case which he bought a new suitcase in Spain later. However, the real disaster was actually the coming back trip!! When we picked up the luggage, we found out that both luggages were broken, there are also 2 breakage spots on my luggage itself, the luggage handle came off and the locks were totally forced broken(so my boyfriend lost totally 2 suitcases for this trip). I have locked them before check-in and my suitcase is the type that came with international lock that can be opened by international key in case the luggage would be spot checked by any airport authority so it should not be forced open in such manner! That aside, when we got home, I opened the luggage just to find out that the things inside were totally flipped over in a big mess! The zipped compartment inside was open and the clothes are all messed up(as messy as a 80% sale basket in the shopping mall), the wrapped present was torn open, wrapping paper and the pieces of present scattered around everywhere in the luggage. Furthermore, my boyfriend's mobile phone(old one with problem which we was thinking to get it fixed in China) and his suit (together with necktie and belt) were stolen! The box of mobile phone was left behind together with the torn open plastic suit bag but both of the items were no where to be found! I tried to call the airline but nobody picked up, now I'm waiting for the reply email which I don't know whether they will even cared to read. Frankly speaking, I have no hope that they will contact us back. So this post is only an example and a warning for you guys to be careful and choose the airline wisely (we bought it because it was the cheapest flight ticket, an obviously resulted as an expensive lesson). For us, this is the first and will be the last time we will ever fly with Aeroflot or transit via Russia. With what had happened, we would not hesitate to pay 100-200 EUR more to get a better flight that transit elsewhere!!!\n",

      "End of March 2012 I made a trip to Manaus, Brazil. It was my first experience with \"long distance travelling\". The flight was booked and payed trough Ebookers.be. The flight itself was made by TAP Portugal. The journey to Manaus was perfect, but on my return happened an unexpected problem. Checking in at Manaus airport for the flight Manaus to Fortaleza, flight made by the Brazilian company GOL, they refused to let me check in. My seat was reserved, but, it seemed that the ticket was not payed by TAP. Even showing my e-ticket and proof of my payment, they refused to let me board. It was at that moment not possible to contact TAP in Brazil or Ebookers. The only way to take that flight was to by another ticket at the GOL-gate, witch costed me 781,00 euro! Arriving at Fortaleza Airport, I adressed myself to the TAP office. They gave me a mailadress where I could make my complaint. Back home, I adressed my complaint first to TAP, but the only answer I received was that I had to fill in the form on their website, witch I did, without any further respons. Since I booked my trip trough Ebookers.be, I repeated my complaint to that company, also by filling in a form on their \"customer-service\" website. You receive an automatic answer with a registration-number and the promise they would answer within 48 hours. 5 days later, I still had no answer. I send them a reminder, but even 2 weeks later, there was no further respons. I send Ebookers another, rather angry mail, on witch they responded the same day with excuses for the delay and the answer that they transmitted my complaint to TAP and that I could expect a compensation by TAP for the extra cost I had to make. Now, 3 months further, I still have no answer or payment by TAP or Ebookers. I presume that mail with complaints are directly transmitted to the \"unwanted mail\" or the \"trash\" map! I don't know how to proceed further in this mather to get any positive answer or repons by either TAP or Ebookers. But it is certain that I cannot recommend these companys for any other trip or flight!\n",

      "I made the unfortunate mistake of booking an emergency trip to the UK thru Minneapolis to LGW with Northwest. In the past I always had good luck with MSP but apparently they have been in the midst of runway work and flights are delayed or cancelled willy nilly (although you can bet it's the smaller cities whose flights are cancelled), Couldn't get into Minn to connect with the UK flight and NW \"service\" was little help. Apparently this has been going on frequently, yesterday the flight got to Minn too late to make the connection. If we had been warned earlier in the day, we could have driven to MSP in 4 hours and made the connection. All NW would offer by phone was a late Thurs flight to Detroit that got into LGW on Friday far too late for us. This suggestion also made it clear that NW wasn't going to guarantee we would be able to get to MSP Thursday eiher. Luckily we listened to the business travelers in line and did not trust the info given by phone, so we stayed in line and the in-person clerk (who was also helping unload planes at the same time) was able to reroute us to get to LGW three hours earlier which gives us a good shot at making the services. It may take all of Thursday to get to Gatwick but at least it's a chance if it all goes well. To add insult to this, while on hold with NW, they were playing an ad offering bonus miles to fly into Msp!!! If they had any kind of conscience they would be warning potential passengers of the delays and they all should change their schedules to avoid these delays. Oh, but then they might lose business, better to have a captive angry passenger than no passenger at all. I have not flown United for quite a number of years since that summer period when they were also stranding passengers in Denver and Chicago. I'm afraid that I'll be avoiding NW, especially their Airlink, for at least that many years after this. I can't think of any other business that I have been lied to and manipulated by for years and years as much as by the airlines. There was a time when I really did enjoy traveling, but that was before the hubs, maximizing seat capacity, disappearance of snacks and cancelling flights to make sure the other flights have no empty seats.\n",

      "The flight itinerary is Seattle-Chicago-Zurich with the Seattle-Chicago leg on United and Chicago-Zurich leg on Swiss. The return is the reverse with Zurich-Chicago on Swiss and Chicago-Seattle on United. I selected this routing because I wanted to purchase from United but fly Swiss for the transatlantic. I already have my seat selections on United through the reservation process, but not on Swiss. I have the Swiss confirmation number from the United web site, but, when I go to the Swiss site, I am apparently not allowed to see or manage the Swiss segments on the Swiss website due to the codeshare. I could use some enlightenment on the process for online check-in on both outbound and return flights and seat selection for the Swiss legs so your input much appreciated. I've flown commercially frequently, but am still a bit inexperienced with codeshares. With United-Air Canada booked through United, I could use the AC locater provided by United on the AC web site to get to my reservation. Seems a bit different this time.\n",

      "I was surprised to discover recently that I am only a few hundred miles away from Medallion Status on Delta. I say \"surprised\" because I generally don't fly enough in a year to get the necessary mileage for any kind of airline status. However in this case I benefited from a couple of trips to the west coast earlier in the year, plus two sizable MQM bonuses that I received courtesy of my Skymiles credit card. I have some long haul trips planned for later this year and early next, so decided to have a go at a Mileage Run to get the remaining miles for the status upgrade. Since I'm new to doing Mileage Runs, I decided to try something not too terribly ambitious - just enough miles to push me over the threshold. I've read that ATL is not a great airport to base out of for this sort of activity, but I did find an inexpensive R/T flight to Louisville that departs on a weekday afternoon, has a short layover at SDF, and then returns to ATL by about 8:00 PM on the same day. It cost about $145 altogether and I'll get 1000 miles out of it - not such a great deal in terms of cost per mile, but for a first effort I guess it's not too bad (plus it's a small financial investment if I have to back out at the last minute out for some reason). Anyway, here's my question. My biggest concern with this is that something will happen in Louisville (delays, etc) and I will miss the return flight to Atlanta. Both flights have the same flight number so I am guessing it's the same physical airplane for both legs. Does anyone have any idea if that's a valid assumption? I figure worst case I can do a one-way car rental and drive home (6 hours) if I miss the return, but would obviously rather fly (note that I only need the outgoing miles for the status upgrade, so no real harm done if that happens). That's really all I wanted to know, I guess. I know that FlyerTalk is probably a better venue to discuss this sort of thing, but I am not active over there (yet!). My wife is very dubious about all of this and thinks I am crazy, so I am just trying to allay some concerns. Thanks for any advice you all can offer. -JimG\n",

      "Our flight (Myself and my girlfriend), number AR7575 from Mendoza to Cordoba at 19:25 was cancelled and nobody advises us anticipatively. Due to the cancelation, we miss our flight from Gol Linhas Areas (from Cordoba to Sao Paulo). After 3 hours waiting, the aerolineas employees schedule a flight to Buenos Aieres in 23/06 at 06:00. So 11 hours later and from a different place. They do not arrange another flight to São Paulo, neither a Hotel. We paid everything from our own (USD 150 from hotels and taxis)and went to Buenos Aires without a granted flight to Sao Paulo. It was possible take a flight to Sao Paulo just in 23/06 at 17:55 from TAM Linhas Aereas paying from our pockets (USD 1000 each one). We lost meetings, and personal arrangements in Sao Paulo due to the cancelation. Furthermore we have a lot of stress (nobody grants us that it would be possible to come back to sao paulo). Aerolineas do not do anything to help us. For luck we had money to do everything from our own. We have all the vouchers and receipts to prove the extra spending. It was an unfortunate experience together Aerolineas and Argentina. Never more we would choose this wretched airline. Furthermore, we will charge everything (all the extra costs) from Aerolineas. If necessary we would contact ANAC and the court. I’m a current flyer (special member from LAN/TAM) and never happens to me. Moreover, if I wasn’t a special member from TAM I would not arrived in Sao Paulo because there wasn’t available flight for us and Aerolineas did anything.\n",

      "Hi, I have travelled twice with Cathay Pacific, Sydney to Rome to Catania in the last 2 years and every time I get my bags back I have a white cable tie on the zip with 'HK' on it. This time around when I picked my bag from lost and found at Catania, I also had a dogana tag on it. My bag was supposed to be checked through to the Catania,and it was always going to go through the secure dogana area where it would be scanned, but the bag went missing in Rome so I was not with the bag when it was scanned. My question is did customs open my bag at both airports? Everything in the bag was a mess this time round, but I'm not sure if this was because of the way it was handled.

      "Hi we recently arrived back from a trip and took flights with Airasia form KUL to CEB we had pre-booked meals for both flights along with exit seats. As we are now Coeliacs (no Gluten) we just booked the basic meals eg Chicken and plain rice. Once on board the meals were served and thats when we noticed the ingredients list on the packaging (contains gluten) so we could not eat the food i explained to staff they said to contact customer services and explain. On arrival I contacted Airasia via the website and explained everything eg, The website states that some of the meals may contain gluten, When in fact ALL of the meals had gluten, so I requested a refund of the return flights pre-booked meals which was some 10 days away. This request was of course rejected but i was given a link to the site again to select and pay for new meals lol that of course i cant eat any. Plus Airasia have a 'no outside food policy' I had anticipated that the level of service from them would be zero, so we did bring some snacks. The moral of the story use yoru mastercard as I did and dispute the transaction on return then they wil actually listen as the Booking was made from the UK our rules apply regardless of the lack of clarity on the Airasia site so I will update the outcome, for me its not about the £20 its more about the priciple now so fight on ;)\n",

      "Just saw this from FlyerTalk and the SFO website - \"San Francisco International Airport (SFO) will conduct a series of temporary runway closures during 2013 to accomplish construction activity for federally-mandated Runway Safety Areas. These closures will primarily consist of weekend closures of either Runway 28L or 28R, which are the primary runways for arriving flights. Only one runway will be closed at any given time. During closures, the arrival rate at SFO will be reduced from 60 aircraft per hour to 30 aircraft per hour. Delays for flights originating within a two-hour radius of SFO are expected to occur during peak travel times. Peak times are between 9:00 a.m. to12:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Travelers are strongly encouraged to contact their respective carriers regarding any potential delays.\" flysfo.com/web/…updates The dates listed are ... Jan. 11-14, Jan. 18-21, Jan. 25-28, April 5-8, April 12-15, April 19-22, April 26-29 , June 25-26 and and June 27-28 . Runways 28-L and 28-R are used for long haul takeoffs and for virtually all landings. The important point to note is that flights to SFO originating at an airport within a 2 hour flying time, will be subject to delays. These airports cover most of the west coast, from San Diego (SAN) in the south to Portland (PDX - my home) in the north. Seattle is a 2hr15 flight from SFO, so may not be immune. These delays already happen when bad weather hits SFO, as flights from nearby airports are subject to flow control. Should bad weather and these closures hit on the same day(s) it could be big time problems. If you have a flight to SFO and an onward connection for these dates, as referenced above you'd be advised to contact your airline. If you're planning on connecting via SFO from a nearby airport on these dates, allow an enormous amount of contingency, and even consider avoiding SFO altogether.\n",

      "This is a terrible, fraudulent company that luers people in through cheap airline tickets. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. My partner and I bought two business class tickets to Belize from San Fransisco and discovered a week later that there were unauthorized charges on our credit card that added up to almost double of the original cost of the tickets. Not only did they try to double charge us but then changed our tickets to coach class on the returning flight. We've been hassling with them for a week to get these issues resolved and so far only one ticket has been changed and only half of the money they owed us has been paid back. After looking this company (aka Solar Tours, Cheapticketabroad.com, etc..) on the BBB website and reading other posts about these companies, we know we are not the only ones who have been scammed. The BBB gives them an F rating. They've had to change their name several times to try and hide the fact that they are a shady company. Doesn't get any worse than that. Does any one have more information or a contact number for this company?

EVery flight out of our city was cancelled. Not my fault. Not Aeromexico's fault. These things happen. So, I called them to see how they were going to handle it. They said a refund was not an option. Fine. Act of God, whatever. So they said they would rebook my flight at a different date but they were sold out until the end of the month. And oh, by the way, I would have to pay the difference between the original ticket price and they ticket price of a different date----which was $500 more than the original ticket price, because the only tickets they had available were during the high season. I think that's poor customer service, but okay. Fine. The guy said I had 10 months to redeem it. Well, I called back three weeks later to rebook it, and he said that I only had two days to rebook the flight, that time had passed, they were taking my money and they would not be giving it back. NO ONE told me this when I talked to them originally. They made it very clear I had up to ten months to rebook it at no charge except for any difference in the ticket price. I explained this and asked to speak to a manager or supervisor. The guy on the phone was *extremely* rude though I was trying to stay calm and cordial with him. I asked 4 times before he finally agreed to let me speak to a supervisor. At which time, he put me on hold and left me there for 45 minutes. Finally, I hung up and called back. The same jerk answered the phone. I tried asking to speak to a supervisor again, and he hung up on me. What. The hell. Do NOT book through Aeromexico for any reason.

I panicked, I read horror stories and read great stories online. What should I do I ask my self. Wait 1/2 a weeks to make a appointment and hope I can get one before my travel date. One of the passport agency worker actually in a way suggested I should wait and set a appointment. I was scared its almost june summer is here its travel season. If I wait I risk not getting appointment in time. Three phone calls to the passport agency and I get a old man Nice calming voice in my state of panic telling me to expediate it. At the time expediated was 2-3 weeks and the clerk at courts said its the 3 week mark. The passport agent told me do it, my response was what if I don't get it in time he stated \" I had a get out of jail free card.\" At 4 days prior to departure if the application is good I can request a emergancey appointment with the Miami agency.. This gave me the kick in the but to expediate it and the relief I had a back up plan.. I herd rumors that the passport agency is the only functional branch of government now I can say confidently that these people are efficient. It only took 7 days, thats right 7 days not business days but days to get it to my door. I right this so the people who are stuck on the fence at the 2-3 week mark and are scared, don't be scared. The passport agency will do what ever they can not to delay you. Suggestions don't forget to put travel date and send it threw clerk of courts or accepted post offices. These certified places make it alittle quicker than you just sending it, Best of Luck and I hope this helps someone in the same situation I was in. _=) Edited: 8:16 pm, May 28, 2016\n",

Just spent the last 3 days trying to fing a good fare to Europe and every time I chose a flight on either of these sites it said the fares were no longer available (or the price had doubled!) but they left them there for 3 days at least(they are still there)!

      "United decided to not go along with its plan to end complimentary hot meals in economy on some international flights. Hot meals will be included on all Trans-Atlantic and Pacifc international flights again from all UA airports in all classes. Here is the email: Dear Mr.(snip), Thank you for your direct, candid feedback on the test we had planned to launch in the fourth quarter for food choices on some of our flights. We heard you and have decided not to move forward with the test of offering customers buy-on-board options in United Economy on certain trans-Atlantic flights. We will continue to offer complimentary hot meals on those flights. The response from you and many of our corporate customers, even before we launched the test, told us what we would have undoubtedly learned had we proceeded - you value our hot meal service in economy class for international flights. In this environment, where higher costs driven by volatile fuel prices are now the norm, we must continue to tailor products and services so that we provide you with choices and competitive fares. As such, we will continue to be proactive in testing new ideas. On October 1, we will proceed with the test of new, complimentary options for United Business customers on three-cabin aircraft used for domestic routes, which represents 16 daily flights. Customers on these flights will receive complimentary fresh sandwiches, salads, breakfast, snack boxes or snacks, depending on the length of flight and time of departure. They will also continue to enjoy complimentary beverages, including beer, wine and cocktails. We will evaluate the results and determine next steps by the end of the year. It's also important to note that full meals will still be served on our p.s. transcontinental flights. Thank you again for your feedback. We will continue to listen and make changes that enable us in this environment to provide you with the choices you value. Sincerely, Graham Atkinson Chief Customer Officer\n",

I chose USAir because the itinerary and times were great and the First Class fare was a steal! I was reading through some of the posts on TA and hear nothing but horror stories about USAir. Are they really much worse than other airlines? It doesn't really matter - we're going no matter what, but I do think I'll be sure to pack stuff in my carry on due to risks of lost luggage!

      "Hi, An interesting article today from USA today's travel section-- which is essentially an encapsulation of a larger, more detailed article written by the Wall Street Journal-- that discusses historical airfares and what people pay today as compared to 1995 levels. While I've mentioned this before, I thought the article was interesting for two reasons.. First, it does confirm what I suspect most people know to be reality.. that being the **average** air fare paid today is in fact LOWER than what you paid **on average** back in 1995 when adjusted for inflation.. Again, this is an average and applies to only US carriers.. but I do think that it applies to most markets-- some more than others, but most markets.. But the more interesting thing that the WSJ author notes-- is that even when you add in checked bag fees and other fees that didn't exist as separate charges back in 1995 (the WSJ author quotes a figure of $21.66 for these fees in total) it's STILL cheaper.. 16% cheaper with the fees added into the comparison, 21% without the fees added..

      "Here is the description of my terrible experience with FlightNetwork: I needed to book round trip tickets to Copenhagen for 3 people. We searched Google flights for the best deal and found a round trip flight for $843 from Flight Network. Since we needed to book using 3 different credit cards, I called FlightNetwork for the booking to ensure that we all get the same price and availability. First, it takes the agent forever to find the flight I am talking about (even using the flight numbers). Then, the agent tells me that the price I am seeing is due to a “glitch” in the system but they would honour this price. I am put on hold for long periods of time in order for the agent to come to this conclusion. It is already 30 minutes that I’m on the call and I have no new information other than the information I already had accessed online in less than 2 minutes. I tell the agent I would like to book with 3 credit cards and apply a promo code (for $20 discount per booking). The agent then asks me for the credit card numbers. Without asking me for my promo code, she has already applied a random promo code that gives $10 discount. I was frustrated at the incompetence of the agent and the long wait times so I decided I would continue the transaction online. I hang up with the agent, go through the online booking system, put in my credit card, click on “Purchase Now”, only to get a pop up that says the online system could not confirm my fare. I refresh the page and suddenly the flight is showing up at $896. I call back 5 minutes after I’ve hung up with the agent the first time, and she tells me that flight prices have gone up. I now decide to proceed with the booking anyway as it is urgent enough for me to book this flight. Another 45 minutes goes by, again long hold times, and my 3 flights are now booked. I receive emails with details of the booking but no invoice. I told myself I would call the next day to ask about the invoice. The next day, I notice the flight is showing at $843 again! And, on top of that, when I log in to the Air Canada website to manage my booking, the purchase price is actually at $843. So when I call back FlightNetwork, I tell them about this and I also tell them that I can’t even confirm what has been charged because I never received an invoice. Again, more ridiculously long hold times - every time, I ask a question, the agent tells me to hold on, puts me on hold for 5-10 minutes and comes back throwing up an answer she received from someone else. What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question. Initially, the agent tells me that she says I was charged $843 mistakenly. I am so confused. Then, she comes back and says oh no, it was $896 that you were charged. Complete chaos!! She sends me the invoice which says that I am paying $285 for the flight and $611.57 in taxes totalling $896.57. Then I tell her that the flight is back to $843 on their website. She says she cannot see this price in their database. I am literally refreshing the page as I speak to the agent and am seeing $843. I had to send a screenshot of what I am seeing on their website to them to prove that I am seeing this price!! She then says that because the flight is book, she cannot refund the difference but can provide it as a credit due to their price drop protection. I was not satisfied with this but looked like I didn’t have another option so I agree and she tells me that it will appear in my account within 3-5 business days. It has been 4 and still nothing but we will see. During the call, I ask to speak with a supervisor and she tells me that the supervisor will basically tell me the same thing… The total time for this call was 1 hour. Then I finally see the charge on my credit card - I see 2 charges. One with the description AIR CANADA totalling $843 and another with description TASF totalling $53. I google TASF and find out this mean travel agent service fee. I am so furious now as they never informed me that this was part of the price they quoted to me!! It is not even detailed in the invoice. I tried calling and the agent tells me that this doesn’t need to be detailed to me, it is part of the total price but I am still not convinced. This is only $53 but the principle of the matter, I was not informed of the details of the charges to my credit card, let alone the absolutely horrible service, I am sure this is in violation of some consumer protection act or travel agents act. Overall absolutely terrible terrible nightmarish experience with FlightNetwork. Not worth the headache and lack of transparency. Embarrassing that this is a Canadian company.\n",

      "Hi, we have booked our Virgin tickets from Brisbane to LAX and return and wanted to know if overbooking seats has affected travellers out there. We booked online and chose our seats specifically because i have had two operations on my knees and need to have a seat where i can get out of the seat easily and excercise my legs, so we have booked a b and c seat the c seat on the aisle. I would hate to think we went to all the expense and then being asked to surrender our seats as we have booked 8 months in advance. Also Virgin do not have a web check-in on international flights only domestic. Has anyone had this problem as i am now a bit worried.\n",

      "I thought I would share our experience. If you have any questions, please ask. Thomson Flight Booking: Easily done online with no problems. We booked extra legroom seats and we felt the cost was worth it. Seat Selection: This was done online as well and it was simple. My only complaint is that we wanted two aisle seats and it wouldn't let me. Online Check in: I checked in a week ahead of time and printed boarding passes. Again, simple and easy. Night before luggage drop: We dropped off our luggage the night before with no stress or problems. I love being able to do this. Flight: Boarding was on time and very efficient. We did take off about 20 minutes later than planned. The flight was comfortable. We had bought a Boots Meal deal at the airport before we went to the plan. So, we did not purchase anything on the plane. We booked extra space seats and they were good value for my tall husband. The flight is about 3 hours from Manchester. Luggage & Immigration in Naples: we disembarked quickly upon landing to a bus. At immigration, the lines went quickly. We had a little wait for the luggage and then off to our transfer. From landing to our transport heading to Sorrento, it took about 1 1/2 hours. The return trip was just as simple and easy. We were pleased with our flights and now look forward to our trip on the Dreamliner this summer.\n",

Although I certainly understand Boise (or as I call it, Spudville!) is NOT a travel hub of any sort, it just shouldn't be this complicated to buy a ticket online, without involving a travel agent! In looking at Korean Air, Cathay Pacific, etc--one cannot \"start\" from Boise, even though they are partners with airlines that do fly into Boise. I really don't want to travel on two separate tickets. I have also tried Matrix--which is usually very helpful in finding a good \"routing\" and price from Spudville. In the past I've found my itinerary, then just gone to the airline website to purchase the ticket. Worked like a charm for last two trips to Europe! With Bangkok, this isn't working--the fares are MUCH higher on the airlines websites than Matrix, and I can't enter Boise as a starting point. I'm looking at traveling mid January 2012 for about 4 weeks. Flying into and out of BKK is fine. Any suggestions or help is much appreciated! Thanks!\n",

      "We just booked a trip with Sunwing to Mexico over the Christmas holidays and although the property was nice, the flight there and back was a nightmare. We signed up for trip alerts and didn't receive any but one that said they were ontime. Instead they were 4 hours late leaving Toronto and did not notify or communicate this to anyone until 15 minutes before when we were supposed to board. They made us wait for over an hour for a voucher for Lunch and then we got $5, which doesn't buy much more than a coffee at Pearson International. We paid for Premium seats because we had heard the seats were tight and then ours seats were double booked. We were worried about lost bags and went with carry on. When we arrived there were people that had lost luggage, I felt especiaily sad for this young teenage girl who was in tears on the bus ride to the resort. Coming home was no better. Web check in wasn't even offered on the way back Delays again coming home and the sign at the gate continued to read on time, even though they were not. They forced us to check our bags or pay several hundred dollars to carry them on even though we had less then when we went down and the bags were standard carry size for any other airline. We arrived so late that we had to pay for a hotel stay at the airport when we got back. On the 7.5 hour flight down we had one drink service that happened 3.5 hours after we boarded. First and last time flying with Sunwing. You couldn't pay me to fly with them ever again.\n",

Clearly I had no idea when I could travel back to the UK. Clearly this advice was absolute rubbish. The Airline and our travel insurance sorted it all out, no problem.

      "Since Usairways merger with American our service and prices have suffered out of Charlotte. My last experience made me vow to never fly them unless I absolutely had to. My wife and I just returned from a round trip via Delta from Charlotte to Jacksonville, FL. We flew first class cheaper than a coach seat on AA. From the moment we stepped up to the ticket counter in Charlotte until we got our baggage back at the end of the trip, it was amazing to experience the difference in service. The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing. Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat, fresh blankets, pillows, and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground, and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles. Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings. The entire crew was dressed very sharply, smiled, and actually thanked us for flying with them. They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service. Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crews....it is common place on AA. It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable. On each leg of the trip, our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim. AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutes. Best decision we've made to switch our business to Delta.\n",

      "We traveled as a family of 12 (6 children and 6 adults) in Executive Class from JFK-DEL in December 2008 and returned from BLR-BOM-EWR Via Heathrow in January 2009 (also Executive). The inflight service on the flight from JFK (772-200LR) was pleasant and seats were comfortable and were flat for sleeping. The airline's grounds services at JFK is not efficient for a large group. There were no Pre-Boarding areas for Executive or Business classes at the gate. The ground servive at BLR was also very inefficient and transit service at BOM was HORRIBLE. The flight from BOM to EWR on 747 was acceptable with good inflight food service, but non-existent entertainment and the seats were not flat. The transit at Heathrow (a refueling and more passengers stop) was the most miserable experience in all our flying years....We would not recommend to anyone flying through Heathrow as transit passengers. Their security staff is rude and there is no concept of organized boarding at Heathrow. Incidentally, there is barely enough time to exit the plane with all your belongings, go through security and make it back to the gate before the plane is supposed to leave. BOTTOM LINE IS: Fly Air India for Non-Stop flights only to India and expect virtually no ground service.\n",

      "I like to fill out the application for travel insurance correctly so that if I should need it in case of emergency, the insurance company can't claim that my application was invalid because I did it wrong. The problem is that I've asked this question 3 times with 3 different telephone reps at Travel Guard Insurance and I've gotten 3 different answers. I don't think the telephone reps understand this either. My question is this: When buying the policy, you have to put down on the application \"trip cost.\" Using BA Avios points for a Business Class ticket, the taxes and fees which I paid were about $1100. (OUCH !!!) The first agent told me to insure the cost of the actual ticket. (I knew this wasn't correct so I called back.) The second agent told me I could only list the cost to re-deposit the points in case of cancellation. This would be $65 USD. I wanted to double-check, so I called back a 3rd time, and the 3rd agent told me to put down the cost of the taxes and fees. In case of cancellation, I would get the taxes and fees back from BA. YIKES....I don't know what to do now? Does anyone know for sure? How do I avoid future trouble about this??? Thanks.\n",

Fortunately,Hilton called USAIR and demanded they send a rep/chaparone to collect the children,and took care of the pair.

      "We've been European travelers for more years than I can remember - at least one trip per year or more. We've never used travel insurance because except on one occasion we've always booked our own flights, hotels, trains, etc. That said - I've noticed a number of posts on this and other boards gently chiding people who've encountered problems in their travels for not purchasing trip insurance policies. This has gotten me thinking that maybe we've just been lucky all these years. Last year, we were in the Benelux countries during the volcano eruption. Our luck held, as the no-fly ban was lifted on the day we left (in fact, our booked tix were on the first UAL flight allowed out of Brussels). So...we're heading to the UK in May and we are taking a Rick Steves tour of Rome in October before heading on to other Italian cities. Now - we are considering taking out policies for both trips.

      "Volaris charged me over $700 for my infant daughter to fly with them, despite the fact that it's against Mexican federal law to charge for an infant. I had purchased tickets for my wife, daughter, and myself online with no problems. Upon arrival at Zacatecas (ZCL) for our flight to Chicago Midway (MDW), they said \"the system\" wouldn't let them check her in because she's two years old (despite the obvious fact to the contrary according to her Mexican *and* US passports). They couldn't get \"el sistema\" to let them issue a boarding pass because we were within the month that she turned two (she was 1 year, 11 months). They gave us the ultimatum: buy a full price ticket or don't fly. Not wanting to miss Thanksgiving dinner, we caved. But, as they were trying to buy the ticket for her as an adult \"el sistema\" wouldn't let them because she was not yet two years old!!! They eventually lied, entered an older age, and gave us the Customer Service number and email address for a refund. Essentially the *same* thing happened on the return flight... except this time they said they had absolutely no record of her ticket and forced us to buy another one. Naturally, customer service at Volaris is a joke in English or Spanish. In Spanish, they'll talk down to you, tell you it was your fault, and stonewall you. They'll refuse to let you speak to a supervisor. In English, they'll sound very nice and helpful and then do nothing, saying they'll call you back after checking with the airport for more details. Surprise, surprise, they never call back. If you then call them back, the supervisor (if you're lucky enough to get one... usually the reps just refuse to connect you) will not take your call, leaving you on hold for hours. If you hang up and work your way through Customer Service to the same supervisor... he'll tell his reps to tell you \"he'll call you right back.\" Two months later, and many, many hours on the phone, still no refund. Next stop PROFECO? Anyone else have this problem? What's the next move (besides obviously never flying with them again and advising everyone I know to do the same)?\n",

      "Hi, has anyone had any problems with HMPO online form when submiting their passport application? I applied for my first adult passport in July/2014 by using the online form available. Approximately six weeks later I received a letter saying I needed to complete a whole new form, this time in paper form. I contacted HMPO and asked why, since my application was complete and with no errors. They told me it was because I had missed Section 4 (details on parents). I went back into the online form, this time taking screen shots with date and time, and surprise, surprise there was no Section 4 in the online version of the form. I was never given the opportunity to write my parents details. I repeated the process several times in different dates and managed to get to the end of the form (screen to complete payment and submit). I tried contacting them by phone, but they insisted that despite the problem I had to go through the whole process again. I tried complaining, had no replies. Phoned again several times, then they finally said they could not find my application, then later on they \"found\" it but that there was no way around it. As a result I have waited for my passport to be processed for more than 8 weeks now - and still no idea when it will be finalised. I read in a similar trip advisor forum (\"Problems with the Passport Office,dated April 2014) that some people, Miss B and Nanny503927 for example, were having similar problems. I would not recommend use of HMPO online form for new applicants... And i was wondering if anyone has had similar issues. Thank you\n",

I booked some flights and elected to pay by Direct Deposit to avoid the credit card surcharge. As my bank is the same as theirs the transaction was processed immediately. Two working days later when I checked my itinerary, it was flagged as pending, unpaid. As when I had originally made the payment it said that the booking would only be held for two days I was a little concerned and phoned their customer service department. When I eventually got through, after some discussion I was asked to send a copy of my bank's confirmation of payment, which I duly did. Later that day I found the itinerary was now marked as paid so I was happy enough with that. However, this morning a Jetstar rep called me to check that everything was now OK and ask if I had received my itinerary (which I had). Not only that, but she had to call four times before I was available to take the call, which I thought was pretty good follow up, I would have thought they'd give up after the second try. They did leave voice mail, but only to say they wanted to speak with me personally, so they also didn't take that out and call it good. I was impressed, better service than I expected.\n",

      "I have not flown internationally in a long time....or even domestically since the invention of the TSA. I therefore had some trepidation about the flight, figuring it would be a royal PITA, no food, and generally where the end would justify the means. Wrong. I chose British Airways Open Skies from Newark to Orly because I had always had good experiences with BA. Also, I liked the idea of a smaller plane with less people. It seemed to be a bit more civilized. I was not disappointed even though we traveled economy. The seats were leather and comfy, and not quite as narrow as some. Our seats were the first row in economy, so although not separated by a wall, there was a lot of leg space between our seats and the last row of business class. We were not treated as if we were the inferior class. We received iPads, a full meal which was quite good, as well as a small breakfast snack before landing...all at no additional cost. Upon the return we were two in three seats, which was terrific. We had a sizable snack, a full meal which was also quite good and another snack prior to landing. The flight crew (captain et al) on both flights were terrific....informative and very personable. The flight attendants were very pleasant, professional and helpful...and love the uniforms as they have a chic retro vibe. Along with the pillow and blanket we received a packet with eye shades, socks, and another item I can't recall. Boarding and disembarking were both a breeze although upon Orly arrival we did not have jetway access but had to disembark on the airfield where a bus waited to take us to the terminal. On the return to Newark we hit a wind shear upon touch down which the female pilot handled very admirably. Luggage retrieval was painless...again, due to far fewer passengers. One point...the 757-200 is a narrow body jet. Therefore the aisles are narrower than many other types of aircraft. Therefore, any bump in the air will cause you to bump the passenger in the seat if walking in the aisle, or be bumped if you are seated. Other than that, the flight was like flying used to be, when passengers were treated like humans, and not cattle. IMO, all,others airlines should,take a page out of the BAOS book. I would fly them again in a heartbeat. Now all they need to add is in flight WiFi, and the service would be perfect.\n",

I want to make sure you know I'm not one of those people. When booking my trip I did request assistance from Allegiant with my luggage, moving through the airport and security, to the gate, and on and off the plane. I tried to be as specific as possible as to the assistance I needed since I was traveling alone. These requests were not out of line and should have all been provided by Allegiant. Instead, Allegiant asked my family member who was dropping me off at the airport to help me to my gate which was a huge inconvieniece for them. On my first leg the gate was changed before the flight and another passenger had to move me to the new gate. But that was nothing compared to how I found my wheelchair every time I received it back from Allegiant after landing. After the first leg, the left arm rest was broken off. I didn't say anything at that time thinking that it was just a \"things happen\" situation. I really lost it though when at the end of my second leg, as I was being wheeled down the ramp, the young man who was wheeling me down wheeled my left wheel partially on the edge of the ramp causing the rubber tire to come off my wheel!! Then he started telling me how it was \"normal wear and tear\". REALLY?!?! When my husband and I got back to our car we inspected the chair closer and found that the edge of the back of the chair had a rip in the vinyl!! It's going to cost me more to repair this chair than it will to just replace it. What makes me so angry is that no one says sorry. My husband worked for an entire day to make this chair fit my personality by painting it sparkly hot pink since I have to spend so much time in it. Now though, I'm house bound because they just didn't care to take care of something that is so important to me. I did contact them, I guess they have 30 days to respond.\n",

So we needed new cases, we wanted strong hard shell weatherproof ones (having seen what happens to soft cases left out in the rain......) and, most importantly, no zips. And we found them ! American Tourister \"Flite\" (Samsonite`s budget range). They`re not the lightest in the world but built like tanks, plastic tanks I grant you, but tanks none the less. You`ll always see loads of them owned by seasoned travellers on airport luggage carousels. They came with a 3 year guarantee, but 4 years later after loads of hard use we needed a spare part for one, it just screwed on and they just put it in the post, for free ! That level of customer service is rare indeed these days. Anyway, earlier this year a friend of mine wanted my advice on what suitcase to buy. I`ve seldom been so certain of any recommendation, buy the American Tourister hard shell suitcases we bought back in 2009, but guess what ? Yes you`re right ! They don`t do them anymore ! In fact they don`t do anything similar and neither does anyone else (well Samsonite do one model, but that was a bit out of her price range).

I had the original eticket from my email inbox but no other information ie boarding passes etc so if you do decide to try and claim this should be the only thing you need to attach to the letter. Also they did send me an email with an offer of a voucher to be redeemed on a future Thomas cook holiday (expires in 12 months) but as I am unable to do that I have asked them to send me a cheque which you are legally entitled to do. From sending the letter to receiving the email today it only took 13 days for a resolution. Good luck if you decide to go for it. :-)\n",

      "My wife and I recently boarded a Malaysia Airlines flight from Perth to Kualar Lumpar. Then onwards to Heathrow. Prior to take off in Perth we were joined in the row in front of us by 3 drunk men who from that moment on set about drinking the cabin dry. After an hour, the one in front of my wife suddenly decided to put his seat into a full recline position hitting my wife in the face. We complained and verbal hostilities arose. We were moved 5 rows back. This was not the end of our troubles. From that point onwards we were threatened contiunally by these men. This was pointed out to the crew. Approaching to land I was told by \"the leader\" that they would be waiting for me in the corridor. This was heard by a Stewardess. A terrifying experience all round. Nothing happened in the corridor but we were on edge continually. Luckily for us, they did not continue on our joining flight to Heathrow. I emailed a complaint to Malaysia Airways and 4 weeks later they have replied sending a 3 line email back saying thanks for my observations and they will review their practices on future flights. The questions is. Do I now leave it at that or is that the best I can expect from a 5 star airline ?????\n",

I tried to complain several times before my travel and even trying to rearrange flights etc and there was no help anywhere so I bascically had to put up and shut up. My issue was I saved money up for a while to be able to treat my mum to a little break away (personal reasons). I booked through low cost holidays iv had holidays through them before with no issues but this time when booking I specifically chose the return flight with Thomas cook and paid a considerable amount more to return with them as theirs was a later flight. After a couple of months I had another email confirmation through as Thomas cook had rescheduled their flight which was 7 hours earlier than the original time and also earlier than other flights I could of chose and paid less for! this resulted in us losing near enough a day off our holiday and also losing out on the extra money I spend choosing to fly with them. Ive tried to complain to low cost holidays but they say its not down to them so my complaint should be to Thomas cook but then when I try to complain to Thomas cook its void as I didn't book with them directly so I basically cant complain to them. Is their a higher body in which I could complain to as this seems to just be a vicious circle and I'm not getting anywhere?\n",

A 7+ hour flight with a family of 4 behind me. The kids were an infant maybe 4 months old and a 2 year old. The kids alternated crying, screaming, howling and seat kicking the entire flight. Parents did nothing to stop this. Directly beside across the aisle were 2 parents with Junior lap baby that looked way to big to be a lap baby. Just before the lunch service Dad decided he was going to change Junior's very soiled diaper right there in the seat. From my vantage point, I could both see and smell everything that was going on. Absolutely vile. Needless to say, I was shocked. Just before landing, round # 2. The parents just rolled up the used diapers and placed them under the seats! The aircraft bathrooms had diaper changing tables too! A lack of class by these parents. Wondering if anyone else has witnessed such rude behavior lately while flying?

Some of my fellow passengers were looking at me very strangely. Turns out that they guy behind me had one of those little dogs which look like a gremlin in a tiny dog carrier under my seat. It continued to yelp incessantly for about 45 minutes. You wouldn't think a little dog could squeal so loud. It wasn't really a bark, more like it was trying to squeal and bark at the same time. Most people around the area reached for their headphones including me but even that could not mask the little tyke out. Was not until I got up for my headphones and mentioned that the dog seemed distressed and that perhaps he should try to calm it down that he picked the poor thing from under the seat. He seemed oblivious to the noise it was making, perhaps he was immune. Give me a screaming child over this little begger any day ;-)\n",

The guy was disgusted of course(the guy on the aisle seat next to the wife must also have refused) and proceeded to sit the entire flight with his legs in a V-position,leaving his left leg halfway under the seat in front of me.He also threw his blanket all over him so that it came into my seat(which i picked up and put over the side of his armrest-no fuss,just removed it from my lap) and stood in the aisle when i went to the restroom once and refused to let me back into my seat b/c \"he needed to stand.\" I could have went to an FA,but it was a 6 hour flight and I didnt want any more issues. Plus I knew there was nowhere else to be moved. Thoughts?? Also,it was definitely a rude guy flight-the passenger in front of me reclined his seat ALL the way back(which is their right,I know,so i did the same)and complained to me that I was bumping the back of his seat everytime I moved around in my seat or got into my bag(which I did once or twice). I did tell him that if he pulled his seat forward he might not notice me as much,but he kept it where it was. Needless to say,the flight was just peachy. Lufthansa was fine,though,service was good despite the passengers. We had in seat entertainment,decent food,plenty of beverage service and free alcohol. Anyway,feedback is appreciated. ------\n",

      "I recently booked Ryanair flights for my husband and his friend. When I began the online check in, I realised the surname of the second adult, the friend, was wrongly entered as the same surname as my husband although his first name was correct. I had failed to notice this on the confirmation email. Rang Ryanair and they said it would cost £160 for them to change the name or £110 if we did it ourselves online. As the hotel was booked, we had little choice but to pay the £110. Protests that the mistake was not ours fell on deaf ears. I wrote to their head office but they refused to be of any assistance. Some googling showed that others had experienced a reversion of the second adult surname to that of the first adult when the website goes to the payment page. I believe this is what happened to us. It also appears their terms of contract may be considered unfair. So I intend to sue them in the county court and wondered if anyone might have any experiences of doing this with Ryanair?\n",

I have a 14 hour overnight layover in Panama City airport and since I'm young and travel-hardy (and poor), I've just decided to suck it up and stay in the international terminal reading and getting some work done. My only concern is that I've seen some posts here and elsewhere that say for layovers lasting more than 12 hours I might need to \"check in\" with Panama somehow (go through some kind of customs/immigration?). Is that true, or can I just get off my plane, hang out for all that time in the terminal, and get on my next flight in the morning? Will anybody actually check up on how long I've been in the airport if I never try to enter the country? I will be checking a bag all the way to Santiago (aka, not picking up in Panama...). Thanks!

      "I booked and paid for a flight on CheapoAir between 2 European cities. Later that day, I saw the carrier offering the same flight, class, limitations on their own website for literally more than 2/3 LESS than what I paid. I provided all the necessary documentation to CoA as instructed under their \"Lowest fare guarantee'. They denied my claim because the carrier's website 'is not a US website'. They cite the lack of a US customer service number as a basis. (Note that an effort to use CoA's US phone number resulted in a 53 minute wait, followed by a disconnect, so I had to use online chat anyway.) I don't see the relevance, other than to contrive a way to not meet their advertised promises, However, it gets worse. CoA sent me a hotel coupon to use in conjunction with my (disputed) flight. I decided to use it to shave my loss. Found the hotel I wanted on the dates I needed. I provided all the information including full credit card data. Agreed to CoA terms, hit Confirm, and received a confirmation of - ANOTHER FLIGHT! Nothing about a hotel., No email confirm. Nothing. Now, forced to endure the one hour phone wait, I spoke to a representative who claimed that AmEx had rejected the charge. I called Amex and they denied that. Lie # 1. The CoA rep (still on the phone) told me she would book it directly, but after several minutes, told me the hotel had sold out, and would I like to book somewhere else? That is Lie # 2, because I promptly went to (very reliable) Hotels.com and successfully booked exactly what CoA had originally offered at the same (pre-coupon) price. I also confirmed the booking with the hotel itself. I've booked many air and hotel tickets with CoA, and never had a problem. However, I also never tried to do anything even slightly out of the ordinary, like use a coupon or rely on a guarantee, This is a trust business. Buh-Bye, CheapoAir,\n",

      "Since Usairways merger with American our service and prices have suffered out of Charlotte. My last experience made me vow to never fly them unless I absolutely had to. My wife and I just returned from a round trip via Delta from Charlotte to Jacksonville, FL. We flew first class cheaper than a coach seat on AA. From the moment we stepped up to the ticket counter in Charlotte until we got our baggage back at the end of the trip, it was amazing to experience the difference in service. The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing. Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat, fresh blankets, pillows, and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground, and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles. Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings. The entire crew was dressed very sharply, smiled, and actually thanked us for flying with them. They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service. Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crews....it is common place on AA. It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable. On each leg of the trip, our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim. AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutes. Best decision we've made to switch our business to Delta.\n",

Once in Minneapolis we were told by Delta that we did not have reservations to fly to Fargo , even though the ticket we received did show a flight , we were then told to see a United ticket agent , and that was in a different terminal . Well off i went , unfortunately the first agent i found was on the phone , he proceeded to tell me , by putting his hand on receiver that he will be on the phone for awhile , i then grabbed my TICKETS and proceeded to the next gate , still not knowing whether we had a flight . The next terminal had an agent dealing with a client , 2 other people were standing just behind the gate having an animated conversation , after 10 mins 1 left and went back to original United gate ..The agent was off the phone , looked at my tickets , reprinted them and said YOU DO have reservations for that flight , go see delta . Off i went to delta again , different terminal again , I was again told by Delta we did not have reservations and I need to go back to United !!!!!!!!!!! At this point I was probably I step away from loosing it , the agent then offered me the United PHONE NUMBER !! ..... After some enormous restraint I insisted she call !! She told me to have a seat , finally I i overheard her mention they had marked an HL or something on the ticket or reservation !!! I have no idea what that meant , shortly after she called us up and asked for our identification !!! we received or tickets and proceeded to our gate ... c 9 then c 10 and then f 1 .... We were a party of 4 , 2 of witch are mid 70 senior citizens , in the 13 hours it took , every time we had to bounce from terminal to terminal they went with us , this was very stress full on them , we had originally boarded united in vegas Friday flight 6659 friday ..I have not checked my credit card statement but we had 2 rooms booked for late check in 130 am saturday morning in Fargo ,ND , as Fargo was not our final destination , so i may find i have been charged for these rooms as well . In Denver the night shift gave us hotel voucher , not used and told use to go to www.unitedapprecition.com for additional information .WE WERE OFFERED 50.00 Travel Voucher !!!!!!! signed SLEEPLESS with UNITED\n",

      "I recently returned from 3 weeks in Europe after flying with BA a few times and just wanted to share my experiences I had with the airline. ---- from YVR to LHR: Departed on time, arrived at LHR 20 minutes early. I paid about $100 extra for an exit row seat (28J) and couldn't recommend this more. The seat is located in the first row in Economy, right behind Club World. After takeoff, they close the curtain and due to there being no toilets here, there's no one walking around to disturb you. My seat was right beside the door which kind of protrudes out. This was used as my leg rest for the entire duration of the flight. If you can't afford Premium Economy, this is a really great option. Dinner was a choice of pasta (with feta and tomatoes) or chicken (with rice and veggies). I had the pasta which was actually quite tasty - by no means a five star meal, but not bad for plane food. The chocolate dessert was delicious. After dinner service, lights went out and it was time to sleep. A word of warning - it's extremely cold by the exits. I had a blanket and jacket but I was still shivering throughout the entire flight. In hindsight, I'm not sure why I didn't ask for an extra blanket - I must have been delirious with sleep... Breakfast is served about an hour before landing. It consisted of a fruit muffin, yogurt, and a box of raisins (?!). Not very filling, but oh well. IFE was average - I only watched one movie before going to sleep. The new releases were nothing to get excited about, so it may be wise to bring your own entertainment. BA85 from LHR to YVR: My experience on this flight was similar to the above, except this time I had seat 29K. This is also an exit row seat but in the second row of economy with a missing seat in front which allows you to enter the aisle by walking in front (and not over your seat mates). It was a good seat but not as good as any of the exit row seats in row 28 which just feel more spacious. This flight departed a bit late and arrived 45 minutes late at YVR. I also flew from LHR to BCN (BA486), and AMS to LHR (BA435) on their smaller planes. Both plane interiors looked brand spanking new. I managed to score exit row seats on both these fights as well which was a nice bonus even though the flights were quite short in duration. There's no IFE but they do serve a small snack and free drinks on both flights. I don't know what the snacks were as I declined them on both flights. Overall, a very good experience with BA. They're definitely my airline of choice when flying to, from, and within Europe, especially if I can get an exit row seat on the international flights. Edited: 11:28 pm, July 13, 2015\n",

Any domestic travel included in your ticket will probably be on South African airline Comair, operating under the British Airways banner. BA/Comair has a “policy” (it happened on both of my flights) of selecting passengers at random and asking them to leave their hand luggage at the door when boarding, as “the cabin is full”. Don’t do it. I did, and had a phone stolen from my bag. When the crew approached me at the door, I asked them if they would stow the bag on board, meaning in the cabin. They said they would. Instead, I ended up collecting my unlocked bag of valuables (minus one) from the carousel in the terminal. To add insult to injury, my bag was well within the regulation size, it fitted comfortably into the overhead locker (on the return trip) and it was all unnecessary as there was plenty of room in the lockers anyway. When I complained to BA at the airport I was told I should not have left valuables in my checked-in luggage! Had I not been so sleep deprived after a long international flight I might have been more circumspect when ambushed by the crew.

      "A Qantas Boeing 747 traveling from London \"lost power from all four of its main generators 15 minutes away from Bangkok, and the pilot was forced to switch to battery back-up for the landing,\" The Sydney Morning Herald reports. The Australian newspaper says the Monday incident \"is set to prompt a worldwide alert to Boeing 747 operators after the problem was traced to a cracked drip tray under the first-class galley.\" In a story from this morning, the Morning Herald says \"water from the blocked drain collected in a drip tray under the floor. A crack in the drip tray caused the water to leak into electrical wiring. Each of the plane's four engines has its own generator, but the water shorted out the aircraft's power supply.\" David Cox, Qantas' executive general manager responsible for engineering, tells The Australian \"it was just like tipping a glass of water into your stereo.\" Dr. Arvind Sinha, director of aerospace at RMIT University in Melbourne, explains to the Morning Herald that \"the engines have their own independent power source and the steering is operated by a hydraulic pump system, but the critical issues are the navigation and communication systems that you need to find your way to a runway to land.\" Colin Adams of the Australian and International Pilot's Association says the Qantas crew and passengers were \"lucky\" that the plane was not far out over open water when the incident occurred, according to the London Daily Mail. \"In that situation you have a minimum of 30 minutes before you lose power to the flight instruments,\" Adams tells the Morning Herald. \"After that the only idea that you have of airspeed and where you are in relation to what's around you is what you can see out of the window. There is no written procedure for what happens in that situation -- it's the pilot and his wits. If you were a long way from an airfield at night it would be an extremely hazardous situation. If you were in cloud you would not know where the ground was and you could end up in an extremely dangerous situation.\" The 747-400 is now back in service for Qantas, according to The Associated Press. \"As a precaution, Qantas has inspected its entire B747-400 fleet and all of these aircraft have been cleared to fly,\" Qantas executive John Borghetti tells The Telegraph of London.

      "EasyJet have announced they will close their base in Madrid this October, pulling all eight aircraft out and redeploying them elsewhere across Europe. Although only 20% of services will be lost within the next year, EasyJet are still selling tickets as normal through the winter season with no route or frequency cuts at all other than Manchester and schedules still show early morning departures and late night arrivals in Madrid, which shows that aircraft is based there. Why are they still selling these flights when us who take only little interest in the aviation industry know they won't happen but others less so will not? I'd say for the time being people DO NOT BOOK EASYJET FLIGHTS TO/FROM MADRID POST OCTOBER 2012 AS THERE'S A CHANCE IT MAY NOT FLY! Give it a couple of weeks or so unless anything happens before hand. Anybody remember when they closed East Midlands flights? They sold them and people were booking them when EasyJet knew they wouldn't fly at that time. Same seems to be happening here!

First got canceled, ergo the second one we missed. Took three other ones instead. On the trip back two flights were planned. Both got canceled even though they were confirmed about three times. Had to take another airline back, skipped last flight and took the train back instead. Had paid for the overseas flight extra for economy plus seats and of course didn't get them since the flight got canceled and we flew with another carrier. Paid $700 for travel insurance, didn't see a penny. Thanks, Undine\n",

Allegiant Flight was 45 minutes late taking off from Memphis because they were \"still loading baggage.\" We arrived in Las Vegas 1 hour past Arrival time. As we landed, the announcement was made to lower all window shades & place seat belts in seats, as the plane was scheduled to depart again quickly. Waited 45 minutes @ Baggage Claim. No bags. Passengers flooded Allegiant Office, where it was \"determined\" that the baggage was not in LAS, nor was it in MEM. & No there's not another flight from MEM today. Maybe tomorrow? By the time most had spent 20 minutes filling out Lost Luggage Forms, I (not one to give up easily) asked an Allegiant Associate if they were sure they had checked all possible cargo areas? @ This point, I'm thinking:: \"Surely they didn't put a whole flight's luggage on a plane to ???\" That would make no sense. It HAS to be HERE!!! She made a phone call:: \"Has anyone checked the middle cargo compartment?\" Held for a few minutes. Then \"Yaaaaaaay!!!!\" Duh . . . 1 more hour before we could retrieve it from the belt. So 2 hours 45 minutes of wasted gambling time. Bet I could have lost @ least $245 by now 😜 You would think they would at least hand out Free Drink Tickets, as we were all dry / parched / & way overdue for 1st cocktail.

I was left stranded in Los Angeles by China Southern. Has anyone else experienced the same difficulty, whether on China Southern or another airline, when their original flight was cancelled?\n",

      "Wondering if anyone has any views on which JFK hotels have the most frequent/reliable airport shuttle service. It's hard to find detailed information on hotel websites, and I can see from some tripadvisor reviews that some hotels only have hourly shuttle services (in which case it's probably worth getting a taxi for early morning flights, and I'll price that in when making my choice). Last time I had a 1 night stopover the hotel only operated a small minivan to get to JFK in the early morning (despite using a bigger vehicle the night before), and we had to wait over 10 minutes for the driver to try to squeeze all the passengers and luggage on, with some luggage/passengers ending up on other people's laps, and some left behind.\n",

      "I know Jetstar regularly get a slating for their delays and bad service, so thought it was only fair I shared the excellent experience we had with them recently. We flew Christchurch NZL to Narita Airport, Tokyo via the Gold Coast Airport. The flights were on time going over, no issues with delays or connections. The flight was delayed an hour coming back, but apart from that we had no issues with onwards connections, lost bags etc. The planes were lovely and service great. The thing that impressed us most was regarding our request to have luggage on the way back. We had booked a while back when they had a 2:1 special (2 fly for price of 1). We booked our basic flights ex Chch. Over the next few weeks we got several emails changing details of our flight. For the most part these were tiny changes: change of terminal, flights changing times by 5-10 minutes (in our favour), however, one of the changes was canning the return flight to Chch and putting us on a flight to Auckland, then a domestic flight to Chch. We didn't have any choice but to accept this as our trip was on quite a tight timeframe. Later we decided that we wanted to have one person with 10kg baggage on the way back to allow for a few souvenirs we planned to get. When we went to do this online, we found that it would cost us $98 (which we were prepared to pay) plus $15 more because of the domestic flight we now had through the change to their scheduling. We decided to wait until the airport and ask them there to waive the $15 as it was not our choice to do that leg. The lady at the airport counter spent quite a bit of time going through our booking history, then she handed us our boarding passes and said no problem. I pulled out my cc to pay for the Narita-AKL baggage and she said there was no charge for that either. We had asked for one person to have 10kg and she loaded 15kg baggage on both our tickets for free. We thought that was pretty good and were happy with that! When we got onto the Gold Coast-Auckland leg of our return flight we discovered we had exit row seats and then when the food trolley came round, the hostess informed us we each had $10 voucher for food. This was our first time flying long haul with a LCC. Even without the freebies we got as compensation for the change of return flight, we found it a good experience and would happily fly Jetstar long haul again out of NZ/Australia.\n",

      "I see a lot of complaints and dissatisfaction by people who have used online reservations websites, and most of the problems people have had appear to be the purchasers' own fault. The reality here, of course, is that there really is nothing unbusiness-like or underhanded, nor are there any \"bait and switch\" tactics in what these sites offer or what they charge as YOU authorize the total amount of charges which you agree to pay when you \"submit.\" It isn't worth complaining if YOUdon't exercise reasonable care -- and READ THE FINE PRINT beforehand -- when using such sites. One thing to always be sure of is that you see a physical address for a legitmate place of business and someone whom you can contact should a problem arise.

They say I have a credit for $1833, but won't let me use it. 8/29/07 I am a physician working in Walnut Creek California. I bought (11/ 6/2006) three United Airline tickets ($1833 visa receipt is attached) from Cheapoair (internet site located in New York) to fly from San Francisco to Cancun on January 20th, 2007. Due to changes at my job, I cancelled my flights well in advance of the departure date. I was told I would now have a monetary credit (minus a $100 penalty per ticket) that could be used for one year. I called and reconfirmed this numerous times. I have been trying to make new reservations for over three months now. At first I tried to use the credit to go to New York (see emails), now I have been simply trying to rebook my original itinerary (SFO to CUN). Every representative tells me I have a credit for $1833, and that they can make me a reservation, but when I go to book the flights they say they have to talk with their booking department and will get back to me. They never do! I have cell phone record of hours of conversation time. I have also sent numerous emails, including a final warning that I would be filing a criminal complaint.

Singapore would be my fave because of the amazing crew who will do abosolutly anything, nothing is too much for them. Entertainment system is top notch, with large screens, and plenty of movies, Tv, games etc, there is something for everyone! Another thing I love about SIA is the legroom.

Two different groups applied for their Esta's. An email was received to say Authorised after the initial word on application said Pending. We could not book in online, it came up as check in at airport. We arrived at Heathrow at 02:30 for a 6am flight. The passport machine would not let us check in. We were directed to different desks around the airport, the final one being the Special Assistance desk. There was already a family with a problem at the desk and there was no senior members of staff to help us. We were told there was a problem with our Esta. We promptly got the Esta number up on our mobile devices but the check in staff said it was too late to book 9 people in and closed the flight!!! We were told to go to the ticket desk and buy new tickets! There was no staff from TAP airlines to help us. The manager eventually came back from the gate and agreed to talk to us. After much discussion we were booked on United flights the following day. Our party of 9 were split up into 5 and 4. 4 going first via Newark, then 5 going 5 hours later via Houston. They would not discuss how we wanted the party split resulting in my daughter's friend flying with our other family members. We were due to arrive in Miami on Sat afternoon but got there Monday morning. We were at Heathrow for 32 hours with children. Tap would not help us with a hotel, meals, nothing!

We had no different documents on the Sunday when we were allowed to fly with United. Our argument is that there should have been someone there to help us.

      "My partner and I recently flew back from Barcelona to Heathrow with BA. The flight was delayed by 2.5 hours, resulting in our getting into Heathrow after midnight, when all public transport other than taxis had ceased running. During the flight, we were told on two occasions by crew that if passengers were to take a taxi home, this would be refunded in full by the airline on presentation of a receipt. On arrival, we received a quote from a London black cab for £85-90 to North London. This would normally be an excessive expense for us, but as it was 12.30am we took the taxi in order to get home quickly (and in the understanding that reimbursement would be forthcoming). The final fare ended up being £97. However, on making a claim and presenting our taxi receipt, we were informed by BA's Customer Relations department that we would only be refunded £50 as the full amount was considered 'beyond reasonable' and it would be 'unfair to other customers' to make an exception. After querying this further - and stressing that passengers were explicitly told that they would be 'fully' refunded for any taxi journeys - we finally learnt (via a response from the airline's Twitter account!) that the maximum compensation given for transport is £50. I wondered if any others have experienced something similar? I think it's fair to say that we and the other passengers were misled by BA, who promised something only to fail to deliver, leaving us considerably out of pocket. They also appear to be completely oblivious to the actual cost of a standard taxi from Heathrow to London! If anybody has any suggestions on alternative channels for proceeding with this, it would be much appreciated. I have already considered raising it with the CAA. ----\n",

The airline had no way of knowing my state of health and physical ability, apart from having flown TK three times previously in the last month, none of these flights being in an exit row. At Ataturk, I mentioned this to a supervisor, and she just handed me the boarding pass and shrugged her shoulders when I asked for an explanation. Incidentally at on-line check in I wasn't able to change the seat allocation, and by the time I got to Ataturk the plane was full, so it was lucky I was able-bodied, and that my able-bodiedness was not required.

      "This might be an inappropriate question to ask on this forum, but I'm not sure where else to post it - and my family and I cannot figure out a decent solution to the problem. Here it is: I have friends and family members who can't or won't be bothered to mail presents (and money is not the problem). They save them up for when I visit and then give them to me then, expecting me to take them back on the plane. Sometimes these gifts are quite bulky; and, as I travel lightly (almost always without checked luggage, and usually with just a back-pack), they never fit into my luggage. On one occasion I ended up checking my backpack to bring the present on board as a carry-on; on another occasion, a family member mailed me the present (and didn't tell the giver that she was doing this). I've kind of had it, and would frankly prefer not to receive anything rather than have to pay $25 to check luggage or put another family member out.

For single flights, we can get the same prices, flying over with Singapore and returning with Etihad, BA, or Qantas. The costs for the two one-way fares is pretty similar to the return fares. Up until today I was pretty sure we would go with the one way fares, mainly because Singapore has such a good name and we could then try (mixed reviews) Etihad on the way home, or Qantas if we wanted the old faithful. What changed today was that Cathay has come into the game with a very competitive return fare and I have heard that they are on a par with Singapore.

      "I recently flew with Thomson and would never do so again. I flew with one checked bag at a meagre 20kg, and my usual hand luggage bag on wheels. All was perfectly fine on the way OUT (hand luggage was given a cursory glance and declared to be fine), but coming home was a different story. The officials at Crete weighed my hand luggage and found it to be overweight. I had NEVER had hand luggage weighed before, even on the Thomson flight out. I was sent to a different desk in order to check in my hand luggage as a second bag for the hold. I was told this would be €25 and begrudgingly agreed to this, pointing out that this had NOT been a problem on the way over for the SAME bag. Upon reaching the desk, I was told that ON TOP of the €25 I had to pay an amount per every kilo this bag weighed. I was presented with a total fee for checking in a very small hand-luggage sized bag, of....wait for it....€133! The staff were rude, dismissive and told me this was Thompson policy and the airline was rigorous in its baggage checks. This obviously only applies on your return flight, where you have no other option of leaving stuff, and struggle to understand the language and make yourself understood. I felt bullied and was reduced to tears. During discussion, I was told my flight was completely full - it was not. I was also told if I didn't pay up, the €133 would be taken from the pocket of the lady working on the Thomson desk! (really?!) There were other people queuing, all bitterly upset with the surcharges dumped on them for the return flight only. I eventually rectified the situation by donating my beach towels and books to Thomson, and wearing approx 4kg of my clothes, thus saving myself €133. Hideous end to a lovely week, all faith in Thomson GONE. PS credit to the amazing cabin crew staff who looked after me on the return flight - i could have hugged you all for your kindness.\n",

So, in addition to the MYR6 you pay to the airlines, you will need to fork out the metered fare plus MYR10 (because you booked the cab as opposed to flagging it down at a cab stand). Do not get cheated by Firefly by opting for this \"taxi service\". I demanded a refund from Firefly and was promptly told I can complain by sending in an email to the airlines!!! How's that for service??!!\n",

      "I have been a Life Member of Qantas Club for years but generally, these days, choose other airlines. For all the smoke and mirrors, Qantas is very ho-hum , ergo, dull and boring. After a series of serious in-flight incidents, the proud kangaroo has had a bit of PR disaster. While Qantas has not had an accident/incident where people died, tarnished is the operative word for them. They are gradually whittling away any benefits at all. Recently I booked with their subsidiary, Jetstar, Sydney - Honolulu return with business options. Here, the add-ons they normally charge to go cattle are generally included. I have a cattle class Sydney-Brisbane return with them as well and that has add-on costs galore. My real beef is the dreadful Jetstar website and lack of connection with that of Daddy QANTAS. In spite of endless patience and a very fast Internet connection, the Jetstar site is woefully slow and has severe Alzheimer's! The site continues to insist that I have no booking for my international leg although I have a confirmed itinerary and a booking number: absolutely a denial that such a booking exists. A call to their customer service department took two days to get through! It kept ringing out or I got a number unreachable message. When I did connect, I was assured there was such a booking but not according to my profile. However, the domestic booking is there! Go figure! With well over 400,000 frequent flyer points, Qantas has a couple of reward options for flight redemptions but of course, taxes can be extreme so one might just as well buy a ticket anyway. To sum up, Qantas is a dead duck and I avoid them generally. My loyalty is focused elsewhere!\n",

      "I just called to clear the outstanding balance of 6 day trip to NY which cost my friend and I £400 EACH - bargain (or so we thought). When I called a few wks ago to pay of £590 I was informed that the airfare taxes had risen by £20pp. At the time of booking the agent who booked the holiday said it was possible that they would rise once before the o/b was paid off but not by much. I was a bit annoyed that I hadn't been called/emailed and informed of this, and that it was casually mentioned at the time of payment but I accepted it s I was told they need my \"ok\" before they could deduct the £590 off my card. I asked at least 3 times if the taxes would rise again and was told no repeatedly. All was fine and with the new £20pp tax fee ...my outstanding balance now stood at £64.90 and my friend's was £54.90. I called today (the last day to pay off the booking) to pay the final £119.80 and am told \"Oh it's £150 you owe madam and if it's not paid today you will lose the holiday\". I've had the worst week imaginable and completely lost my cool as I found it incredibly cheeky that they appeared to have plucked this sum out of the air as I had had my o/b confirmed to me repeatedly during the last phone call 3 weeks ago!! I disputed the o/b and went through the maths with the woman on the phone who couldn't understand what I was saying and was in a bloody call centre in India and who said that she'd escalate my complaint to a manager who'd call tomorrow...cue more ranting from me that today was the last day to pay the o/b and that a phone call tomorrow would be useless if she was saying that I'd lose the holiday if it wasn't paid off today. I asked to be transferred through to the sales team as she was in the customer services team and seemingly in a differennt country! After being put on hold for a while an English sounding guy came on the line, asking what the problem was..at this point I'm in tears as I'm so stressed out and he tells me \"You won't lose the holiday as you're talking to me now. You called us, it's fine. Your tickets have been dispatched anyway\". He says that the price of the holiday may have gone up and didn't I get any emails from the woman who booked it for me bk in October. I haven't heard from here since the day I bloody booked it!!!!!! I tell him how I was told that the taxes would not be rising again and how I'd budgeted down to the last penny for what I believed I owed. He gave me this agents direct line telling me she'd be in tomorrow 9:00-5:30pm and that she knew more about the booking and would be able to help me. I'm so angry at this shoddy service from Travelocity. You can't go adding money onto peoples outstanding balances without informing them beforehand!!! I lost my job recently so money is tight at the moment and to say I'm still shaking with anger is not an exaggeration! I was in bloody tears to the guy on the phone. I'm so stressed out at the moment. They can't do this again can they??? They'd have the call on tape where I was told in no terms would the taxes be rising again.. I wasn't even told by the lady in India where the additional £30 had come from!!!!!!!! Will be ringing the lady who booked the trip for me first thing tomorrow morning but would appreciate any advice if possible. Many thanks for reading my rant ....*and breathe*\n",

That wasn't a big drama, but a bit annoying when you book through an agent for some service. The real problem started at the airport, we tried to check in but the airline had no record of our booking even though Orbitz had issued us paper tickets showing apparent valid ticket numbers. I tried to call Orbitz at the airport but by the time I finally got to speak to someone and have them understand that a) I was at the airport trying to check in b) No, i didn't want to cancel my booking and c) I am Australian, so my zip code has only 4 digits, we were forced to purchase new tickets at the airport to be able to board at a cost of around $250 before check-in close. Since the flight, I have tried to contact Alitalia about the issue, with no response whatsoever and Orbitz by email, who just say to call. When I call, I'm repeatedly put on hold (paying international call rates) and was told on the last call that \"Orbitz will not refund the tickets as the airline re-accommodated us on a later flight.\" They do not read my emails or listen to what I have to say (ie. we only got on the later flight after we purchased new tickets), just keep repeating the line that the airline put on a later flight. I don't want a refund for the original tickets, I want a refund for the more expensive tickets that we had to purchase at the airport! Any ideas of what else I can do?

I travel a lot to/from Sydney and use Jetstar 6+ times a month which of course always take off and land at T2 in Sydney.

A lot of us pay $450+ per year for a Qantas Club membership - if you cant fly Qantas (because they now fly Jetstar) the lounge in T2 was well worth it. Qantas say \"oh, just use the lounge in T3\" - well, easier said than done - you have to go through security at T3 to get to the Qantas lounge (ever done that at 7am in the morning), then leave T3 and go through security again at T2. Qantas say they haven't had very many complaints on this closure (have you ever tried to navigate the Qantas web site to find a complaint form?). I did then was sent an invite to join the American Express® Qantas Corporate Card program - what?

      "Dear Readers I recently (June and July2010) travelled to Europe from Australia with my wife and 3 children aged 16,11 and 9. We visited France, Greece and England. I booked and paid for 3 flights with Easy Jet prior to our departure. The first two flights were uneventful. However our last flight from Athens to London ended up blowing my holiday budget out of the water. We were booked on an Olympic Air flight out of Paros in the Greek Islands a flight that is 20 minutes in length and was scheduled to depart at 16.05pm. Our Easy Jet Connection was due to depart at 19.00 and check in closed at 18.20. Due to the late incoming plane to Paros we did not arrive in at Athens airport until 17.55pm and we were promptly transferred to the terminal by an awaiting bus and were in the terminal at 18.00. I advised my wife and children to go and retrieve the bags and I raced up to the Easy Jet counter to commence check in. By the time I got to the counter it was 18.18pm on my watch and on the clocks in the terminal but there were no Easy Jet staff at the check in at all. The next day there was an Air Traffic Controllers strike that had been scheduled and we had non-refundable accommodation and other paid activities in London. I went looking for the Easy Jet representative in the Terminal who advised that as it was at that stage, 18.21pm by her watch the flight had closed, there were no staff available and there was nothing she could do other than advise us that due to industrial action and bookings we would not be likely to get paid seats with Easy Jet for 3 days. Faced with this I looked for flights departing to London that night and found a British Airways flight due to depart at 19.10. I was advised by a BA representative that she may be able to get 5 seats but would not know until 18.40. She managed to get 5 economy seats for which I was charged in excess of EURO2500 or Australian $3557.00. I spoke to BA the next day in London and a staff member told me that I was charged adult fares for the two children under 12 and that I should be entitled to a 25% refund. The battle to do this is still going on with the BA refunds section and the initial response that I received when the matter was referred to BA customer relations was that BA only have 2 classes of economy seats adult and infant ie 2 and under. There website would suggest otherwise. I have written to Easy Jet and am awaiting a response and will detail it in this forum when it is to hand. I think the moral of this story is that allow the widest possible berth between connection if travelling on a discount carrier. Do not accept the check in closure time will be adhered to by staff of a budget carrier and make sure that you have travel insurance that covers the scenario of a missed connection, as many policies in this regard will only give you a limited amount in very limited circumstances. I will keep you all posted. ------- Sydney\n",

      "We returned Saturday evening from London via British Airway. Part of our bucket list (things we want to experience before we \"kick the bucket\") was to fly British Airways First Class and/or Business Class. I hope anyone with a love of travel and have traveled for many years squeezed into \"the back\", can have this experience!. All you need to do is save up those Frequent Flyer miles for years and years of loyally flying the Star Alliance airlines in the narrow, crowded seats and keeping a sense of humor knowing you are doing your favorite thing, traveling to far away countries. We will probably never again be able to afford to travel this way, certainly not enough time to collect miles nor save enough money....BUT , the memory of this experience on British Airways will last until the end of our days. In past years when I traveled domestically first class for business with my employer paying the fare , it was NOTHING like this. Airlines, and service have come a long way, Never could I imagine this experience. I remember boarding in the back, under the tail, and walking up the aisle, and using a pillow for a tray....Ahhh, and now sleeping pods, pajamas, slippers, 5 star meals, top shelf spirits and the most polite incredible flight attendants, obviously the creme de la creme.. Now, we two \"mature\" people celebrating our 50th anniversary, know what goes on behind the curtain!. I hope all you lovers of travel can share the experience one day.\n",

That is why I was so glad to hear Pres Obama himself proclaiming the wonderful advances in passenger processing at DFW for US Citz plus anyone travelling with ESTA. Therefore I was horrified by the 3hrs line up yesterday at DFW, making hundreds miss their connections (I had booked a 4hr connection - so we made it). The reason for the lines? 3 booths out of 28 were open. 1hr later they opened 16 more. Yes, there were 6 international flights landing within 20 mintues of each other, but in this day and age they must surely be fully aware of the number of passengers on each flight, their nationalities and their exact arrival time - many hours in advance. And to think we travelled via DFW in order to avoid LAX - not next time we wont Rant over !\n",

      "Some of you may remember my post from last year: tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g1-i10702-k64972… The thread appears to have been frozen, however I resurrect it now to give you an update ... Until last week I hadn't flown from CWL since the incident in the previous thread, but last Monday once again my contact lens solution was selected at for testing ... Once again, the staff were polite and professional - but this time I was prepared! My regular \"explosive\" solution was in my checked luggage, and in my hand luggage I was just carrying a 100ml bottle of solution that Specsavers said shouldn't test positive - and they were right. It passed the swab test and I was allowed to take it with me. In all the years I've been travelling I have never had contact lens solution tested at any other airport (apart from once in Bilbao, when they suspected it was something totally different - but that's another story ...), but maybe this will help anyone travelling through Cardiff with contact lens solution in their hand luggage - they seem to be on the lookout for it (I was assured I was simply chosen at random, though I'm sure I spotted a look of glee in the security staff eyes when they saw the bottle going through the X-ray machine ...). For clarification, the solution that tested positive was Specsavers' Easyvision Allpurpose solution; the \"safe\" solution is the Easyvision Multipurpose. If anyone needs a 100ml bottle, they have a stock in Specsavers in Queen Street Cardiff ;-)\n",

We're flying British Airways from LHR to Singapore, but our connecting flight is on Jetstar, and as we have quite a long time between flights in Changi (12 hours), we would like to make use of the transit hotel. However, as we will not be checked in from London straight through to Bali, we will have to reclaim our bags from the BA flight and then check in to the Jetstar one. As far as I can tell, both airlines use Terminal 1. My question is: will we be classed as transit passengers and therefore be able to use the transit hotel? My concern is that we will have to clear immigration in order to collect our bags, but then find that we are stuck landside and unable to use the hotel because check-in for our Jetstar flight to Bali doesn't open until several hours after our flight from London arrives.

But Speedbird recently linked me to an AA wikie, which linked to the Flyertalk forum, where I read about XPlats not getting upgraded on certain routes. Plus we were on a direct which was only going to be 5 stickers instead of the usual 7 for that connecting routing...so we figured we had no chance. Checking the website the night before (well within our 24 hr. window...still nothing). But when we got to the airport the next day and I was at the kiosk, the first thing that caught my eye was \"TWO MEALS\" - yeah baby, we've hit the big time, LOL. Yes, it was only on a direct MD-80 = but it was still cool. Loved the nuts, the free food, the chocolate chip cookies. Won't get anymore free stickers until we fly 10,000 (which will definitely happen this year), but yeah, it was sure nice.

If you booked Premium Class this went up to 45kg PER PASSENGER!! I've been in touch with them and they refuse to budge! I've since cancelled my holiday with them and booked through Cosmos and got exactly the deal I was after..... 3 weeks in Kenya to look forward to, and 45kg of luggage each.

With the rising cost of fuel the airline has found ways of reducing the fuel bill by reducing the weight it carries on its flights. They will be shrinking the size of its in-flight magazines from A4 to A5 size, carrying less ice on flights and believe it or not, \"encouraging\" staff to watch their weight - with the motivation of appearing in the annual Ryanair calendar! But Ryanair are only following in the foot steps of other airlines ... In the 1980's, American Airlines claimed that they saved $40,000 by taking out one olive from every salad in first class and more recently, Japanese airline All Nippon Airways started asking passengers to go to the toilet before boarding in a bid to reduce carbon emissions!

We already have allocated seats, so as far as I can see the only extra thing that online check-in offers is that you don't have to have your boarding pass printed at the check-in desk. Things that are putting me off are: (1) I've noticed over the past couple of years that because now most people are checking in online, the queues for the online check-in desks are often actually longer than the queues for people who haven't checked in online (2) Last year we had a 12 hour flight delay - the original plane had a problem and the airline then split passengers into two groups and people who had NOT checked in online were flown out on a much earlier plane than those who had checked in online - goodness knows why.\n",

The airport — in the midst of a massive facelift — has shrunk considerably, leading to serpentine queues that regularly delay flights.

There is an alternative earlier flight to Vienna but unfortunately it's at 6am which means no sleep, an expensive transfer to the airport and a 4 hour wait at Vienna which significantly lengthens the flight.

      "Our son lives in Atlanta and from time to time we get our grandchildren to come visit us in Florida. They have been flying in and out of Orlando on Air Tran. Now this is NOT a rant post against Air Tran but I am going to start flying them on Delta out of Melbourne. Reason being that the last two times we went to Orlando the service was so slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow that they missed the booked flight. Their luggage made it A ok but it took so long to get me a gate pass after they were checked in that we did not get to the gate in time. The problem seems to be two fold. First of all there are NOT enough agents to handle the load. Second is that you must stand in a line that is at the very end of the ticketing area and do not have a dedicated agent to deal with. So you must wait until another line is empty or another agent comes from the \"back\" to assist you. Maybe it is just Orlando and not Air Tran but I have never had any of those problems flying from Melbourne. Additionaly the security at Orlando is poorly organized and the TSA agents are in no hurry to get you to the airside on time.

      "I appreciate that there are still alot of stranded people out there and I hope you all get home soon. but here was our story. I thought it best to wait 'till we all got home so we can give hopefully a balanced perspective of events. We were due to fly home on 15th April, when it all first happened from Atlanta. We were about 250 miles from the airport, just waking up in our hotel room when we heard the news on CNN, and obviously devastated. It was more the \"not knowing\" than anything else. The website (BA) told us not to go to the airport, and it was about 2.5 hours to speak to someone on the phone. We had to go and return the rental car anyway at ATL so had some hours to calm down and think a bit, rather than turn up to check in totally unaware and panic. The news in the U.S on this was fairly low key at the time from what we saw, and we got more information by logging on to UK news websites, it really felt like doom and gloom from what the media were saying. On our arrival at check in, we handed in my pre printed boarding passes to the BA check in staff, and decided just to book ourselves on the next available flight out, which was 6 days later. Again feeling devastated by the wait and potential additional expense that wasn't budgeted for (or so we thought). The kids were upset, the wife too, however \"keep calm\" I said to myself, trying to hold it all together ,as there is nothing you can do. BA check in staff were truely exceptional, along with ATL dispatchers for the flight (BA226 ATL-LHR on 15th Apr '10). Although they could not doing anything about the flight, their service went beyond the call of duty in terms of help, advice, and being put up in a hotel nearby with all meals paid for. BA, the hotel staff, ATL staff, and the British Consulate in downtown all worked together for the benefit of the passengers. All of them worked 110% to help us, and it will never be forgotten. I was aware of the other horror stories from other airlines just \"dumping\" their passengers with little more than $7 per day to survive on. We remember a group of 4/5 parent helpers looking after 20 or so kids who were representing the UK in a robotic tournament in Atlanta flying on an American airline who had to start paying out of their own pockets. I hope you got back safely if you're reading this. We also rememberd at the consulate, another passenger \"dumped\" by another European airline, with no one to talk to, speak to, or given any advice until the Consulate stepped in. There are hundreds more I know, and we are lucky to be what I think are the fortunate few who flew on BA. I'm not one to hype up BA, as I had some reservations on flying with them, but after this experience, and if I ever decide to fly again then there will only be 1 airline to choose from. I hope everyone can receive some form of recompense. Up to then my faith in British society had been strained to say the least, but this experience is something I'll never forget, that yes there are people out there who care and want to make a difference. I hope everyone out there still gets home safely and quickly.\n",

      "Hi, As information for any US passport holder or future applicant. New passport fees will become effective from 13 July 2010 onward. This is for all applications lodged *on or after* this date. Remember if you use a passport acceptance office (like a US post office) or one of the regional Department of State Passport Offices, it's the date on which you actually file or submit your application that will determine the fee matrix. If you are eligible to, and use regular US Mail for submission, it's the post mark date that will govern. Note that the one of the biggest increases (expressed as percentage) is in the additional page insert fee, which goes from *free* to $82 per insert added. Here's the entire new fee matrix from the DoS' Passport Services page: travel.state.gov/passport/fees/fees_5079.html If your passport is going to expire soon, will have less than 6 months validity, or you need to add extra pages, this would be an *excellent* time to do so, before the new fee matrix becomes applicable.

      "What a diabolical service AA provide. We had never used them before & got to LAX for a flight to Las Vegas only to find out it had been cancelled. Even though mobile phone number was provided when booking made, I received no phone call or SMS. We were not even trandferred or wait listed on the following flight (even though I hold a gold card (emerald) for a partner airline). Told us we were booked on a flight 6 hours later which would have meant we would have missed our pre-booked trips in Vegas. After inquiring about car hire & how long it would take to drive - we were informed that we'd get there before the one were not wait listed on would have even taken off !!! After a bit more complaining the manager came out & offered t omove us across to United Airlins. I bet that hurt :-) Return flight to Hawaii was not much better either, but we'll save that for another time. Spoke to Rolf Saxon at Las Vegas airport who wasflying on our flight to San Fran (on Virgin America) & even he said he would NOT fly with AA, & being an actor he is flying around alll the time !!!\n",

      "My mother (who has balance issues and walks with a cane) plans to fly alone to visit relatives out of state. I know I can arrange for a wheelchair at the airport so that she won't have to walk the long distance through the terminal to the gate. My problem is that I would like to accompany her to the gate and wait with her for her flight, so that if she needs to use the bathroom (which is a very frequent need for her) while waiting, I can help her get to the restroom safely. I believe, however, that since 9/11 only ticketed passengers are allowed to go through security to the gate. Does anyone know if there are any exceptions made to this rule, and if so how to arrange this? The airport that she will be flying out of is LaGuardia in NYC. Thank you for your help.\n",

After reporting the problem via their website, I searched the internet to find all kinds of horrible results to similar situations including having to repurchase the ticket (without refund) at the current going rate. The current rate is now $500 more than it was a week ago! I would like to thank Shirley from International Reservations for her diligent persistence in helping me to correct a name error. Without her help, I would still be worrying whether TSA would allow my mother to fly with the ticket on which I incorrectly entered my last name instead of hers.

      "Yesterday I flew home from Jeddah via Doha on Qater Airways. On boarding the flight from Doha to Manchester it was quite chaotic in the forward economy cabin of the Airbus A330. Numerous families had unilaterally decided to seat themselves together regardless of their seat assignments. The poor FA spent 15 mins trying to get people into their correct seats. I reserved my usual aisle seat, but I had now been moved into a central aisle seat rather than my usual window aisle seat. I would hazard a guess this occurred to try and keep a family on the same row if possible, no big deal to be honest. However in my row was a mother and 2 children. The father of the family demanded rather than ask that I change seats with him, now if he'd been seated in business then fair enough, even accounting for his rather rude attitude. However he was seated in a centre seat behind me, I told him sorry but I dislike to being trapped in. He then became extremely rude, at which point I reported him to the FA. The FA had a word with him and he went off in Huff to his seat. Several hours later his young son looked at me and said \" your the nasty bl@@dy man who wouldn't move\" I guess that comment says it all really, clearly such language shouldn't come from a 3 yr old child. I have moved before to try and assist a family, as long as it's a similar seat close by then that's fine. This rather rude incident will definitely give me pause for thought in future. I think it was the overriding rude sense of entitlement that annoyed me. Regards Rick\n",

      "The reason of this email is to explain an unfortunate situation, me and other 10 passengers suffered at the Denpasar Airport on the 19 of December 2015. We arrived at the Denpasar airport, 19 of December 2015 with the flight VA65 from Sydney. Virgin. Now, we went to the transit Area in Denpasar and ask for Qatar Airways assistance. Nobody was there to do the checkin for transit passengers. We requested assitance to the airport personnel, but they did not help at all and told us that I we did not want to loose the connection flight, we had to do custom clearance, get our luggage and do the check in again at the Qatar desk. The personnel of the airport was disrespectful and with a total lack of customer service attitude. We had little time to decide and we finally made to the check in counter of qatar at the airport. When we did the check in, we were charged 200.000 rp which I think is completely wrong. 1) The airport tax was included in my ticket as the regulation changed on February 2015, Denpasar Airport tax was included , as I booked my flight during Sept 2015. 2) We were passenger in transit that did not get any help from Qatar or airport personnel and we wanted to take our flight. Passengers in transit should not pay the 200.000 rp. So, for the above stated, and because it was Qatar airways the carrier collecting the money, I am requesting the refund of it as I paid it twice. Another point to have in mind, right now I am at the Denpasar airport again, as a transit passenger, I arrived from Doha with Qatar airways and I am connecting to Sydey with Virgin. Virgin personnel was waiting for us on the transit counter of the airport of Denpasar, we did the check in and we did not pay for anything. So Virgin did his part on this situation, and Qatar did not.\n",

I've avoided this airline for so long, because everybody I know told me to basically avoid Aeroflot unless absolutely necessary. I'm looking for a decent ticket for my fly between North Europe and Tokyo. The cheaper the better when it comes to price, but flight duration is more important to me. I just looked up and the fastest is with either Aeroflot or Finnair for this route. But there is a huge price difference (Aeroflot is offering one-way tickets for 1/3 of Finnair's price). My dilemma is that other routs are much longer than these. I don't want to have a layover in Continental Europe because that becomes a detour. But Finnair's prices are more expensive than other airlines that offer flights from Europe to Tokyo. I'm debating if it's safe to fly with Aeroflot... I've seen comments that say it's not that bad any more. But then again, I hear horrific stories. If you've flown with Aeroflot recently, I'd love to hear your story, especially between Moscow-Tokyo.

We are both airline crew so were wise to the excuses they gave. They basically blamed snow, Spanish ATC and fog at Gatwick, all of which were lies! The airline were most unhelpful and had no reps at any point during the delay and lied to us about the reason for the heavy delay. Thomson couldn't even send a rep the next day to the Gatwick Hilton hotel with details of our departure time and on our return we should have been given a letter stating a technical problem for the delay not all the lies originally given. Despite asking for an address to write to for compensation via the rep in the Maldives she failed to give us a letter on why the delay happened, which we were entitled to and had to get a copy of this via a kind passenger.

      "My daughter and her boyfriend had a delay last year when flying home from Majorca. We followed all the guidelines and wrote requesting compensation for the 4 hour delay. Thomsons declined stating it was extra ordinary circumstances. Basically the flight from Majorca was delayed because the flight into majorca was delayed due to ongoing planned roundworks near to the airport causing \"some staff and passengers to be late for the outgoing flight\". These roadworks had been ongoing for more than 2 weeks prior to the date and therefore all staff/passengers should have been aware of the possibilities of delays and allowed extra time. The flight was also n a Sunday evening so this should have not been as much of a problem as it would have been at peak traffic times. After they declined my daughter wrote to the Spanish aviation authority and they agreed and advised compensation should be paid to the amount of é400 per passenger. Thomsons still refused and have refused to answer any further communication. She did all the communication via the online form - should we send in one last letter by post or should we proceed to the small claims court and in our opinions do you think she has a good chance of succeeding with the compensation claim.\n",

As part of the ticket I paid the fee for Economy Comfort seat for 4 legs (JFK-AMS, AMS-EBB, EBB-AMS, AMS-ATL). Since October I've routinely checked my itinerary online and up until yesterday everything was in order. Yesterday I checked and noticed that my Econ Comfort seats for the JFK-AMS and AMS-EBB legs were missing. I've contact KLM via email; they say their records only show the purchase for the two returning legs. I emailed them a copy of my receipt showing the purchase of all 4 seats and am waiting to hear back from them. My question is: does this happen often? I looked at the seat map and the flights appear to be very full. I'm concerned that if my seats have been re-sold or given away, I will be out of luck. It's not about getting a refund if that happens, I really want those seats. 24 hours of flying is tough but the KLM Economy Comfort product makes the trip much more pleasant.\n",

      "British Airways has refused to reimburse us (wife and I) for expenses we incurred due to their cancellation of our flight. They offered $150 travel voucher each. Our costs are $470.44. We arrived at LHR at 10AM on May 24, 2013. BA advised that all flights were now canceled until 4PM. That meant our 3PM flight to CPH was canceled. We stood in line at BA Customer Service for ten hours, along with hundreds of others. Customer Service only opened 4 windows. As the hours crawled by - tempers flared. We got to the window at 8PM. No flights available this day, nor the next day - that would get us to CPH in time for the evening sailing of our cruise ship. We agreed to an 10AM standby for CPH, and a alternative code share routing that would get us close to the port where the ship would be on the second sailing day. We spent the night wandering Heathrow Airport, and retrieved our checked luggage. Not much sleep. Next morning - no luck at Standby. Rushed to the alternate plan - and flew up to Manchester UK. Then - rushed to another terminal to partner Lufthanza for a flight to Munich Germany. From there, Lufthanza toHamburg - where we arrived at midnight of May 25 - on a weekend night - without a hotel reservation. Taxied to a hotel (very lucky) and got a few hours sleep. May 26 - off to the train station: took train to Rostock, them S-bahn to Warnemunde. Hurray - that is where our cruise ship was now docked. We made it - No Thanks to British Airways - to whom we had submitted all our documentation. And - to be clear about all this: We are requesting Nothing for the Ten hours we futilely stood in line, for the stress and aggravation, for the no sleep, no food at the Heathrow airport.

      "I have recently switched to Clear Care, a hydrogen peroxide based contact lens solution, due to my eye care professional's recommendation. In a few months, this will be my first time traveling with it (by air). I have been hearing stories of TSA officers confiscating such solution in carry on baggage and not being able to negotiate citing medical necessity as a reason, even when the bottle is in compliance with the 3-1-1 limitation. The reasoning is that hydrogen peroxide can potentially be used as an explosive. I am wondering what people's experiences are with this? I have always known that it is best to have enough of your contact lens care material in your carry on baggage in case your checked baggage gets delayed. However, I now use exclusively Clear Care, and if that does not make it through TSA, I will be left with nothing upon arrival if my checked baggage gets delayed.

      "Hi Just booked a flight with Ryanair and cannot find an option to add Advanced Passenger Information anywhere, even in Manage my Booking. I usually travel with Easyjet so am used to filling in the information on their website. Where can I fill it in if travelling with Ryanair? I have heard that you now add all the details when checking in online instead of having a separate page to fill in whenever you like. However, I thought that API was required at least 48 hours before the flight time, yet Ryanair allow you to check in up to 4 hours before the flight leaves, so how does this work? Is there a well-hidden API option somewhere that I have missed? Many thanks in advance\n",

I tried to complain several times before my travel and even trying to rearrange flights etc and there was no help anywhere so I bascically had to put up and shut up. My issue was I saved money up for a while to be able to treat my mum to a little break away (personal reasons). I booked through low cost holidays iv had holidays through them before with no issues but this time when booking I specifically chose the return flight with Thomas cook and paid a considerable amount more to return with them as theirs was a later flight. After a couple of months I had another email confirmation through as Thomas cook had rescheduled their flight which was 7 hours earlier than the original time and also earlier than other flights I could of chose and paid less for! this resulted in us losing near enough a day off our holiday and also losing out on the extra money I spend choosing to fly with them. Ive tried to complain to low cost holidays but they say its not down to them so my complaint should be to Thomas cook but then when I try to complain to Thomas cook its void as I didn't book with them directly so I basically cant complain to them. Is their a higher body in which I could complain to as this seems to just be a vicious circle and I'm not getting anywhere?\n",

A 7+ hour flight with a family of 4 behind me. The kids were an infant maybe 4 months old and a 2 year old. The kids alternated crying, screaming, howling and seat kicking the entire flight. Parents did nothing to stop this. Directly beside across the aisle were 2 parents with Junior lap baby that looked way to big to be a lap baby. Just before the lunch service Dad decided he was going to change Junior's very soiled diaper right there in the seat. From my vantage point, I could both see and smell everything that was going on. Absolutely vile. Needless to say, I was shocked. Just before landing, round # 2. The parents just rolled up the used diapers and placed them under the seats! The aircraft bathrooms had diaper changing tables too! A lack of class by these parents. Wondering if anyone else has witnessed such rude behavior lately while flying? Would you have complained to the Crew?\n",

Some of my fellow passengers were looking at me very strangely. Turns out that they guy behind me had one of those little dogs which look like a gremlin in a tiny dog carrier under my seat. It continued to yelp incessantly for about 45 minutes. You wouldn't think a little dog could squeal so loud. It wasn't really a bark, more like it was trying to squeal and bark at the same time. Most people around the area reached for their headphones including me but even that could not mask the little tyke out. Was not until I got up for my headphones and mentioned that the dog seemed distressed and that perhaps he should try to calm it down that he picked the poor thing from under the seat. He seemed oblivious to the noise it was making, perhaps he was immune. Give me a screaming child over this little begger any day ;-)\n",

What are the latest thoughts on refusing to switch seats,especially when there's retaliation? My flight last night from JFK-FRA on Lufthansa was PACKED,and I guess a lot of people had their seats screwed up(so the pilot said as we were taxiing to the runway). I was on an aisle of a 4 seat section,and the guy next to me asked if I would switch with his wife,who was in the row ahead of us,in a middle seat. I declined,as I tend to be a somewhat anxious flyer(i dont show it,but I do need aisle access) and i reserved my seat 2 months ago. The guy was disgusted of course(the guy on the aisle seat next to the wife must also have refused) and proceeded to sit the entire flight with his legs in a V-position,leaving his left leg halfway under the seat in front of me.He also threw his blanket all over him so that it came into my seat(which i picked up and put over the side of his armrest-no fuss,just removed it from my lap) and stood in the aisle when i went to the restroom once and refused to let me back into my seat b/c \"he needed to stand.\" I could have went to an FA,but it was a 6 hour flight and I didnt want any more issues. Plus I knew there was nowhere else to be moved. Thoughts?? Also,it was definitely a rude guy flight-the passenger in front of me reclined his seat ALL the way back(which is their right,I know,so i did the same)and complained to me that I was bumping the back of his seat everytime I moved around in my seat or got into my bag(which I did once or twice). I did tell him that if he pulled his seat forward he might not notice me as much,but he kept it where it was. Needless to say,the flight was just peachy. Lufthansa was fine,though,service was good despite the passengers. We had in seat entertainment,decent food,plenty of beverage service and free alcohol. Anyway,feedback is appreciated. ------\n",

      "I recently booked Ryanair flights for my husband and his friend. When I began the online check in, I realised the surname of the second adult, the friend, was wrongly entered as the same surname as my husband although his first name was correct. I had failed to notice this on the confirmation email. Rang Ryanair and they said it would cost £160 for them to change the name or £110 if we did it ourselves online. As the hotel was booked, we had little choice but to pay the £110. Protests that the mistake was not ours fell on deaf ears. I wrote to their head office but they refused to be of any assistance. Some googling showed that others had experienced a reversion of the second adult surname to that of the first adult when the website goes to the payment page. I believe this is what happened to us.

Later that day, I saw the carrier offering the same flight, class, limitations on their own website for literally more than 2/3 LESS than what I paid. I provided all the necessary documentation to CoA as instructed under their \"Lowest fare guarantee'. They denied my claim because the carrier's website 'is not a US website'. They cite the lack of a US customer service number as a basis. (Note that an effort to use CoA's US phone number resulted in a 53 minute wait, followed by a disconnect, so I had to use online chat anyway.) I don't see the relevance, other than to contrive a way to not meet their advertised promises, However, it gets worse. CoA sent me a hotel coupon to use in conjunction with my (disputed) flight. I decided to use it to shave my loss. Found the hotel I wanted on the dates I needed. I provided all the information including full credit card data. Agreed to CoA terms, hit Confirm, and received a confirmation of - ANOTHER FLIGHT! Nothing about a hotel., No email confirm. Nothing. Now, forced to endure the one hour phone wait, I spoke to a representative who claimed that AmEx had rejected the charge. I called Amex and they denied that. Lie # 1. The CoA rep (still on the phone) told me she would book it directly, but after several minutes, told me the hotel had sold out, and would I like to book somewhere else? That is Lie # 2, because I promptly went to (very reliable) Hotels.com and successfully booked exactly what CoA had originally offered at the same (pre-coupon) price. I also confirmed the booking with the hotel itself. I've booked many air and hotel tickets with CoA, and never had a problem. However, I also never tried to do anything even slightly out of the ordinary, like use a coupon or rely on a guarantee, This is a trust business. Buh-Bye, CheapoAir,\n",

Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat, fresh blankets, pillows, and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground, and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles. Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings. The entire crew was dressed very sharply, smiled, and actually thanked us for flying with them. They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service. Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crews....it is common place on AA. It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable. On each leg of the trip, our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim. AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutes. Best decision we've made to switch our business to Delta.\n",

Once in Minneapolis we were told by Delta that we did not have reservations to fly to Fargo , even though the ticket we received did show a flight , we were then told to see a United ticket agent , and that was in a different terminal . Well off i went , unfortunately the first agent i found was on the phone , he proceeded to tell me , by putting his hand on receiver that he will be on the phone for awhile , i then grabbed my TICKETS and proceeded to the next gate , still not knowing whether we had a flight . The next terminal had an agent dealing with a client , 2 other people were standing just behind the gate having an animated conversation , after 10 mins 1 left and went back to original United gate ..The agent was off the phone , looked at my tickets , reprinted them and said YOU DO have reservations for that flight , go see delta . Off i went to delta again , different terminal again , I was again told by Delta we did not have reservations and I need to go back to United !!!!!!!!!!! At this point I was probably I step away from loosing it , the agent then offered me the United PHONE NUMBER !! ..... After some enormous restraint I insisted she call !! She told me to have a seat , finally I i overheard her mention they had marked an HL or something on the ticket or reservation !!! I have no idea what that meant , shortly after she called us up and asked for our identification !!! we received or tickets and proceeded to our gate ... c 9 then c 10 and then f 1 .... We were a party of 4 , 2 of witch are mid 70 senior citizens , in the 13 hours it took , every time we had to bounce from terminal to terminal they went with us , this was very stress full on them , we had originally boarded united in vegas Friday flight 6659 friday ..I have not checked my credit card statement but we had 2 rooms booked for late check in 130 am saturday morning in Fargo ,ND , as Fargo was not our final destination , so i may find i have been charged for these rooms as well . In Denver the night shift gave us hotel voucher , not used and told use to go to www.unitedapprecition.com for additional information .WE WERE OFFERED 50.00 Travel Voucher !!!!!!! signed SLEEPLESS with UNITED\n",

      "I recently returned from 3 weeks in Europe after flying with BA a few times and just wanted to share my experiences I had with the airline. ---- from YVR to LHR: Departed on time, arrived at LHR 20 minutes early. I paid about $100 extra for an exit row seat (28J) and couldn't recommend this more. The seat is located in the first row in Economy, right behind Club World. After takeoff, they close the curtain and due to there being no toilets here, there's no one walking around to disturb you. My seat was right beside the door which kind of protrudes out. This was used as my leg rest for the entire duration of the flight. If you can't afford Premium Economy, this is a really great option. Dinner was a choice of pasta (with feta and tomatoes) or chicken (with rice and veggies). I had the pasta which was actually quite tasty - by no means a five star meal, but not bad for plane food. The chocolate dessert was delicious. After dinner service, lights went out and it was time to sleep. A word of warning - it's extremely cold by the exits. I had a blanket and jacket but I was still shivering throughout the entire flight. In hindsight, I'm not sure why I didn't ask for an extra blanket - I must have been delirious with sleep... Breakfast is served about an hour before landing. It consisted of a fruit muffin, yogurt, and a box of raisins (?!). Not very filling, but oh well. IFE was average - I only watched one movie before going to sleep. The new releases were nothing to get excited about, so it may be wise to bring your own entertainment. BA85 from LHR to YVR: My experience on this flight was similar to the above, except this time I had seat 29K. This is also an exit row seat but in the second row of economy with a missing seat in front which allows you to enter the aisle by walking in front (and not over your seat mates). It was a good seat but not as good as any of the exit row seats in row 28 which just feel more spacious. This flight departed a bit late and arrived 45 minutes late at YVR. I also flew from LHR to BCN (BA486), and AMS to LHR (BA435) on their smaller planes. Both plane interiors looked brand spanking new. I managed to score exit row seats on both these fights as well which was a nice bonus even though the flights were quite short in duration. There's no IFE but they do serve a small snack and free drinks on both flights. I don't know what the snacks were as I declined them on both flights. Overall, a very good experience with BA. They're definitely my airline of choice when flying to, from, and within Europe, especially if I can get an exit row seat on the international flights. Edited: 11:28 pm, July 13, 2015\n",

      "Hold on to your hand luggage if you are travelling to South Africa on British Airways. Any domestic travel included in your ticket will probably be on South African airline Comair, operating under the British Airways banner. BA/Comair has a “policy” (it happened on both of my flights) of selecting passengers at random and asking them to leave their hand luggage at the door when boarding, as “the cabin is full”. Don’t do it. I did, and had a phone stolen from my bag. When the crew approached me at the door, I asked them if they would stow the bag on board, meaning in the cabin. They said they would. Instead, I ended up collecting my unlocked bag of valuables (minus one) from the carousel in the terminal. To add insult to injury, my bag was well within the regulation size, it fitted comfortably into the overhead locker (on the return trip) and it was all unnecessary as there was plenty of room in the lockers anyway. When I complained to BA at the airport I was told I should not have left valuables in my checked-in luggage! Had I not been so sleep deprived after a long international flight I might have been more circumspect when ambushed by the crew. BA/Comair has not responded to any of the three emails I have sent them. So much for me being accommodating.\n",

      "A Qantas Boeing 747 traveling from London \"lost power from all four of its main generators 15 minutes away from Bangkok, and the pilot was forced to switch to battery back-up for the landing,\" The Sydney Morning Herald reports. The Australian newspaper says the Monday incident \"is set to prompt a worldwide alert to Boeing 747 operators after the problem was traced to a cracked drip tray under the first-class galley.\" In a story from this morning, the Morning Herald says \"water from the blocked drain collected in a drip tray under the floor. A crack in the drip tray caused the water to leak into electrical wiring. Each of the plane's four engines has its own generator, but the water shorted out the aircraft's power supply.\" David Cox, Qantas' executive general manager responsible for engineering, tells The Australian \"it was just like tipping a glass of water into your stereo.\" Dr. Arvind Sinha, director of aerospace at RMIT University in Melbourne, explains to the Morning Herald that \"the engines have their own independent power source and the steering is operated by a hydraulic pump system, but the critical issues are the navigation and communication systems that you need to find your way to a runway to land.\" Colin Adams of the Australian and International Pilot's Association says the Qantas crew and passengers were \"lucky\" that the plane was not far out over open water when the incident occurred, according to the London Daily Mail. \"In that situation you have a minimum of 30 minutes before you lose power to the flight instruments,\" Adams tells the Morning Herald. \"After that the only idea that you have of airspeed and where you are in relation to what's around you is what you can see out of the window. There is no written procedure for what happens in that situation -- it's the pilot and his wits. If you were a long way from an airfield at night it would be an extremely hazardous situation. If you were in cloud you would not know where the ground was and you could end up in an extremely dangerous situation.\" The 747-400 is now back in service for Qantas, according to The Associated Press. \"As a precaution, Qantas has inspected its entire B747-400 fleet and all of these aircraft have been cleared to fly,\" Qantas executive John Borghetti tells The Telegraph of London.

Why are they still selling these flights when us who take only little interest in the aviation industry know they won't happen but others less so will not?

My travel dates are flexible but I can't find any sites that will let me ask for air fares over a date range (except Air NZ that will show prices across a week).

Allegiant Flight was 45 minutes late taking off from Memphis because they were \"still loading baggage.\" We arrived in Las Vegas 1 hour past Arrival time. As we landed, the announcement was made to lower all window shades & place seat belts in seats, as the plane was scheduled to depart again quickly. Waited 45 minutes @ Baggage Claim. No bags. Passengers flooded Allegiant Office, where it was \"determined\" that the baggage was not in LAS, nor was it in MEM. & No there's not another flight from MEM today. Maybe tomorrow? By the time most had spent 20 minutes filling out Lost Luggage Forms, I (not one to give up easily) asked an Allegiant Associate if they were sure they had checked all possible cargo areas? @ This point, I'm thinking:: \"Surely they didn't put a whole flight's luggage on a plane to ???\" That would make no sense. It HAS to be HERE!!! She made a phone call:: \"Has anyone checked the middle cargo compartment?\" Held for a few minutes. Then \"Yaaaaaaay!!!!\" Duh . . . 1 more hour before we could retrieve it from the belt. So 2 hours 45 minutes of wasted gambling time. Bet I could have lost @ least $245 by now 😜 You would think they would at least hand out Free Drink Tickets, as we were all dry / parched / & way overdue for 1st cocktail.

There was a flight at 1500 but after procrastinating about what to do and hanging on the phone to Easyjet that quickly filled up as KLM also cancelled their morning flights to and from EDI. Moral of this story is don't hang about in these situations. Carpe diem and grab the next available flight before some other bugg3r does. Anyway will miss the meal but these things happen. Never had a flight cancelled before due to weather but it would have to be today of all days.At least EZY managed to let me know by text and e-mail BEFORE I left for Schiphol.

      "I know Jetstar regularly get a slating for their delays and bad service, so thought it was only fair I shared the excellent experience we had with them recently. We flew Christchurch NZL to Narita Airport, Tokyo via the Gold Coast Airport. The flights were on time going over, no issues with delays or connections. The flight was delayed an hour coming back, but apart from that we had no issues with onwards connections, lost bags etc. The planes were lovely and service great. The thing that impressed us most was regarding our request to have luggage on the way back. We had booked a while back when they had a 2:1 special (2 fly for price of 1). We booked our basic flights ex Chch. Over the next few weeks we got several emails changing details of our flight. For the most part these were tiny changes: change of terminal, flights changing times by 5-10 minutes (in our favour), however, one of the changes was canning the return flight to Chch and putting us on a flight to Auckland, then a domestic flight to Chch. We didn't have any choice but to accept this as our trip was on quite a tight timeframe. Later we decided that we wanted to have one person with 10kg baggage on the way back to allow for a few souvenirs we planned to get. When we went to do this online, we found that it would cost us $98 (which we were prepared to pay) plus $15 more because of the domestic flight we now had through the change to their scheduling. We decided to wait until the airport and ask them there to waive the $15 as it was not our choice to do that leg. The lady at the airport counter spent quite a bit of time going through our booking history, then she handed us our boarding passes and said no problem. I pulled out my cc to pay for the Narita-AKL baggage and she said there was no charge for that either. We had asked for one person to have 10kg and she loaded 15kg baggage on both our tickets for free. We thought that was pretty good and were happy with that! When we got onto the Gold Coast-Auckland leg of our return flight we discovered we had exit row seats and then when the food trolley came round, the hostess informed us we each had $10 voucher for food. This was our first time flying long haul with a LCC. Even without the freebies we got as compensation for the change of return flight, we found it a good experience and would happily fly Jetstar long haul again out of NZ/Australia.\n",

      "Based on airlines you have personally flown, which would be your favourites? I have flown Qantas, Jetstar, Virgin Blue, Pacific blue, Air Nz, Continental, Tiger Airways, Air Asia, Thai, Singapore, Vietnam Air, Bangkok Airways, Freedom Air, Emitates, British Airways, United, Emirates, Easyjet and probably a few more I can't remember. Singapore would be my fave because of the amazing crew who will do abosolutly anything, nothing is too much for them. Entertainment system is top notch, with large screens, and plenty of movies, Tv, games etc, there is something for everyone! Another thing I love about SIA is the legroom. I don't know the stats but even in economy I feel there is much more leg room than other carriers. And finally the food. Sia by far IMO has the best food of an airline.

      "Just wondering if anyone has experienced anything like this. We were booked onto a TAP flight from Heathrow to Lisbon, Lisbon to Miami in July 2015 as a party of 9. Two different groups applied for their Esta's. An email was received to say Authorised after the initial word on application said Pending. We could not book in online, it came up as check in at airport. We arrived at Heathrow at 02:30 for a 6am flight. The passport machine would not let us check in. We were directed to different desks around the airport, the final one being the Special Assistance desk. There was already a family with a problem at the desk and there was no senior members of staff to help us. We were told there was a problem with our Esta. We promptly got the Esta number up on our mobile devices but the check in staff said it was too late to book 9 people in and closed the flight!!! We were told to go to the ticket desk and buy new tickets! There was no staff from TAP airlines to help us. The manager eventually came back from the gate and agreed to talk to us. After much discussion we were booked on United flights the following day. Our party of 9 were split up into 5 and 4. 4 going first via Newark, then 5 going 5 hours later via Houston. They would not discuss how we wanted the party split resulting in my daughter's friend flying with our other family members. We were due to arrive in Miami on Sat afternoon but got there Monday morning. We were at Heathrow for 32 hours with children. Tap would not help us with a hotel, meals, nothing! We have a case open with the CAA but at this point TAP are saying we did not have the correct documents. We did have them and produced them, there was no-one to help us at Heathrow. We had no different documents on the Sunday when we were allowed to fly with United. Our argument is that there should have been someone there to help us. An immigration officer at the airport said our problem could have been sorted out by the airline in minutes. Has anyone got any advice on this? TIA ---\n",

      "My partner and I recently flew back from Barcelona to Heathrow with BA. The flight was delayed by 2.5 hours, resulting in our getting into Heathrow after midnight, when all public transport other than taxis had ceased running. During the flight, we were told on two occasions by crew that if passengers were to take a taxi home, this would be refunded in full by the airline on presentation of a receipt. On arrival, we received a quote from a London black cab for £85-90 to North London. This would normally be an excessive expense for us, but as it was 12.30am we took the taxi in order to get home quickly (and in the understanding that reimbursement would be forthcoming). The final fare ended up being £97. However, on making a claim and presenting our taxi receipt, we were informed by BA's Customer Relations department that we would only be refunded £50 as the full amount was considered 'beyond reasonable' and it would be 'unfair to other customers' to make an exception. After querying this further - and stressing that passengers were explicitly told that they would be 'fully' refunded for any taxi journeys - we finally learnt (via a response from the airline's Twitter account!) that the maximum compensation given for transport is £50. I wondered if any others have experienced something similar? I think it's fair to say that we and the other passengers were misled by BA, who promised something only to fail to deliver, leaving us considerably out of pocket. They also appear to be completely oblivious to the actual cost of a standard taxi from Heathrow to London! If anybody has any suggestions on alternative channels for proceeding with this, it would be much appreciated. I have already considered raising it with the CAA. ----\n",

      "This might be an inappropriate question to ask on this forum, but I'm not sure where else to post it - and my family and I cannot figure out a decent solution to the problem. Here it is: I have friends and family members who can't or won't be bothered to mail presents (and money is not the problem). They save them up for when I visit and then give them to me then, expecting me to take them back on the plane. Sometimes these gifts are quite bulky; and, as I travel lightly (almost always without checked luggage, and usually with just a back-pack), they never fit into my luggage. On one occasion I ended up checking my backpack to bring the present on board as a carry-on; on another occasion, a family member mailed me the present (and didn't tell the giver that she was doing this). I've kind of had it, and would frankly prefer not to receive anything rather than have to pay $25 to check luggage or put another family member out. I would greatly appreciate any tactful suggestion about how to handle this situation.\n",

Etihad had the best return fares but have disappeared at the moment, with the next best being Malaysian, followed closely by BA and Cathay Pacific. For single flights, we can get the same prices, flying over with Singapore and returning with Etihad, BA, or Qantas. The costs for the two one-way fares is pretty similar to the return fares. Up until today I was pretty sure we would go with the one way fares, mainly because Singapore has such a good name and we could then try (mixed reviews) Etihad on the way home, or Qantas if we wanted the old faithful. What changed today was that Cathay has come into the game with a very competitive return fare and I have heard that they are on a par with Singapore. If this is right, it would seem that taking the Cathay return fare would be the best option. Would love to hear any opinions from those who have comparisons or experiences with any of the above.

      "I recently flew with Thomson and would never do so again. I flew with one checked bag at a meagre 20kg, and my usual hand luggage bag on wheels. All was perfectly fine on the way OUT (hand luggage was given a cursory glance and declared to be fine), but coming home was a different story. The officials at Crete weighed my hand luggage and found it to be overweight. I had NEVER had hand luggage weighed before, even on the Thomson flight out. I was sent to a different desk in order to check in my hand luggage as a second bag for the hold. I was told this would be €25 and begrudgingly agreed to this, pointing out that this had NOT been a problem on the way over for the SAME bag. Upon reaching the desk, I was told that ON TOP of the €25 I had to pay an amount per every kilo this bag weighed. I was presented with a total fee for checking in a very small hand-luggage sized bag, of....wait for it....€133! The staff were rude, dismissive and told me this was Thompson policy and the airline was rigorous in its baggage checks. This obviously only applies on your return flight, where you have no other option of leaving stuff, and struggle to understand the language and make yourself understood. I felt bullied and was reduced to tears. During discussion, I was told my flight was completely full - it was not. I was also told if I didn't pay up, the €133 would be taken from the pocket of the lady working on the Thomson desk! (really?!) There were other people queuing, all bitterly upset with the surcharges dumped on them for the return flight only. I eventually rectified the situation by donating my beach towels and books to Thomson, and wearing approx 4kg of my clothes, thus saving myself €133. Hideous end to a lovely week, all faith in Thomson GONE. PS credit to the amazing cabin crew staff who looked after me on the return flight - i could have hugged you all for your kindness.\n",

After a series of serious in-flight incidents, the proud kangaroo has had a bit of PR disaster. While Qantas has not had an accident/incident where people died, tarnished is the operative word for them. They are gradually whittling away any benefits at all. Recently I booked with their subsidiary, Jetstar, Sydney - Honolulu return with business options. Here, the add-ons they normally charge to go cattle are generally included. I have a cattle class Sydney-Brisbane return with them as well and that has add-on costs galore. My real beef is the dreadful Jetstar website and lack of connection with that of Daddy QANTAS. In spite of endless patience and a very fast Internet connection, the Jetstar site is woefully slow and has severe Alzheimer's! The site continues to insist that I have no booking for my international leg although I have a confirmed itinerary and a booking number: absolutely a denial that such a booking exists. A call to their customer service department took two days to get through! It kept ringing out or I got a number unreachable message. When I did connect, I was assured there was such a booking but not according to my profile. However, the domestic booking is there! Go figure! With well over 400,000 frequent flyer points, Qantas has a couple of reward options for flight redemptions but of course, taxes can be extreme so one might just as well buy a ticket anyway. To sum up, Qantas is a dead duck and I avoid them generally. My loyalty is focused elsewhere!\n",

      "I just called to clear the outstanding balance of 6 day trip to NY which cost my friend and I £400 EACH - bargain (or so we thought). When I called a few wks ago to pay of £590 I was informed that the airfare taxes had risen by £20pp. At the time of booking the agent who booked the holiday said it was possible that they would rise once before the o/b was paid off but not by much. I was a bit annoyed that I hadn't been called/emailed and informed of this, and that it was casually mentioned at the time of payment but I accepted it s I was told they need my \"ok\" before they could deduct the £590 off my card. I asked at least 3 times if the taxes would rise again and was told no repeatedly. All was fine and with the new £20pp tax fee ...my outstanding balance now stood at £64.90 and my friend's was £54.90. I called today (the last day to pay off the booking) to pay the final £119.80 and am told \"Oh it's £150 you owe madam and if it's not paid today you will lose the holiday\". I've had the worst week imaginable and completely lost my cool as I found it incredibly cheeky that they appeared to have plucked this sum out of the air as I had had my o/b confirmed to me repeatedly during the last phone call 3 weeks ago!! I disputed the o/b and went through the maths with the woman on the phone who couldn't understand what I was saying and was in a bloody call centre in India and who said that she'd escalate my complaint to a manager who'd call tomorrow...cue more ranting from me that today was the last day to pay the o/b and that a phone call tomorrow would be useless if she was saying that I'd lose the holiday if it wasn't paid off today. I asked to be transferred through to the sales team as she was in the customer services team and seemingly in a differennt country! After being put on hold for a while an English sounding guy came on the line, asking what the problem was..at this point I'm in tears as I'm so stressed out and he tells me \"You won't lose the holiday as you're talking to me now. You called us, it's fine. Your tickets have been dispatched anyway\". He says that the price of the holiday may have gone up and didn't I get any emails from the woman who booked it for me bk in October. I haven't heard from here since the day I bloody booked it!!!!!! I tell him how I was told that the taxes would not be rising again and how I'd budgeted down to the last penny for what I believed I owed. He gave me this agents direct line telling me she'd be in tomorrow 9:00-5:30pm and that she knew more about the booking and would be able to help me. I'm so angry at this shoddy service from Travelocity. You can't go adding money onto peoples outstanding balances without informing them beforehand!!! I lost my job recently so money is tight at the moment and to say I'm still shaking with anger is not an exaggeration! I was in bloody tears to the guy on the phone. I'm so stressed out at the moment. They can't do this again can they??? They'd have the call on tape where I was told in no terms would the taxes be rising again.. I wasn't even told by the lady in India where the additional £30 had come from!!!!!!!! Will be ringing the lady who booked the trip for me first thing tomorrow morning but would appreciate any advice if possible. Many thanks for reading my rant ....*and breathe*\n",

They did not contact us and when we got to the airport we found a phone at their counter and were told we were pretty much out of luck. They had not made alternate arrangements, nor could they help. We did not have the credit card we'd used for purchase and were told to call when we got home and they'd refund our money. We specifically asked if we needed to do anything else and were told all we needed was the credit card. Now that we're home they're saying we need to return the paper tickets that the other person was wrong. I find if ludicrous that they strand us and then try to shift responsibility to us for their mistake. We don't have the tickets, so we're supposed to talk to corporate. We've left messages 3 times now and no one is calling back. The only phone number on the website is to reservations and they will send a message, that goes unanswered.

      "Booked a flight from Prague to Venice through Orbitz on Alitalia. The flight time changed, but Orbitz didn't notify us, I just happened to check the Alitalia website the day before. That wasn't a big drama, but a bit annoying when you book through an agent for some service. The real problem started at the airport, we tried to check in but the airline had no record of our booking even though Orbitz had issued us paper tickets showing apparent valid ticket numbers. I tried to call Orbitz at the airport but by the time I finally got to speak to someone and have them understand that a) I was at the airport trying to check in b) No, i didn't want to cancel my booking and c) I am Australian, so my zip code has only 4 digits, we were forced to purchase new tickets at the airport to be able to board at a cost of around $250 before check-in close. Since the flight, I have tried to contact Alitalia about the issue, with no response whatsoever and Orbitz by email, who just say to call. When I call, I'm repeatedly put on hold (paying international call rates) and was told on the last call that \"Orbitz will not refund the tickets as the airline re-accommodated us on a later flight.\" They do not read my emails or listen to what I have to say (ie. we only got on the later flight after we purchased new tickets), just keep repeating the line that the airline put on a later flight. I don't want a refund for the original tickets, I want a refund for the more expensive tickets that we had to purchase at the airport! Any ideas of what else I can do? I'm sure we have some rights under the Montreal Convention but it's hard to make any claims when you get no response from the airline or incoherent, useless responses from the agent!\n",

      "Over the years Qantas has moved out of many regional routes and replaced their Qantas flights with Jetstar. I travel a lot to/from Sydney and use Jetstar 6+ times a month which of course always take off and land at T2 in Sydney. So, Qantas in its wisdom (or a sign of the economic times) has closed the Qantas Club Lounge at T2. A lot of us pay $450+ per year for a Qantas Club membership - if you cant fly Qantas (because they now fly Jetstar) the lounge in T2 was well worth it. Qantas say \"oh, just use the lounge in T3\" - well, easier said than done - you have to go through security at T3 to get to the Qantas lounge (ever done that at 7am in the morning), then leave T3 and go through security again at T2. Qantas say they haven't had very many complaints on this closure (have you ever tried to navigate the Qantas web site to find a complaint form?). I did then was sent an invite to join the American Express® Qantas Corporate Card program - what? Maybe if 1,000 people decide not to renew their Qantas Club membership then the loss of $450,000 might create a rethink in the halls of power and they will reopen a (smaller) T2 Qantas lounge. Yeah, maybe not. In any event if you agree and think this is a bad decision please post to this forum topic. Ill be happy to let Qantas know.\n",

      "Dear Readers I recently (June and July2010) travelled to Europe from Australia with my wife and 3 children aged 16,11 and 9. We visited France, Greece and England. I booked and paid for 3 flights with Easy Jet prior to our departure. The first two flights were uneventful. However our last flight from Athens to London ended up blowing my holiday budget out of the water. We were booked on an Olympic Air flight out of Paros in the Greek Islands a flight that is 20 minutes in length and was scheduled to depart at 16.05pm. Our Easy Jet Connection was due to depart at 19.00 and check in closed at 18.20. Due to the late incoming plane to Paros we did not arrive in at Athens airport until 17.55pm and we were promptly transferred to the terminal by an awaiting bus and were in the terminal at 18.00. I advised my wife and children to go and retrieve the bags and I raced up to the Easy Jet counter to commence check in. By the time I got to the counter it was 18.18pm on my watch and on the clocks in the terminal but there were no Easy Jet staff at the check in at all. The next day there was an Air Traffic Controllers strike that had been scheduled and we had non-refundable accommodation and other paid activities in London. I went looking for the Easy Jet representative in the Terminal who advised that as it was at that stage, 18.21pm by her watch the flight had closed, there were no staff available and there was nothing she could do other than advise us that due to industrial action and bookings we would not be likely to get paid seats with Easy Jet for 3 days. Faced with this I looked for flights departing to London that night and found a British Airways flight due to depart at 19.10. I was advised by a BA representative that she may be able to get 5 seats but would not know until 18.40. She managed to get 5 economy seats for which I was charged in excess of EURO2500 or Australian $3557.00. I spoke to BA the next day in London and a staff member told me that I was charged adult fares for the two children under 12 and that I should be entitled to a 25% refund. The battle to do this is still going on with the BA refunds section and the initial response that I received when the matter was referred to BA customer relations was that BA only have 2 classes of economy seats adult and infant ie 2 and under. There website would suggest otherwise. I have written to Easy Jet and am awaiting a response and will detail it in this forum when it is to hand. I think the moral of this story is that allow the widest possible berth between connection if travelling on a discount carrier. Do not accept the check in closure time will be adhered to by staff of a budget carrier and make sure that you have travel insurance that covers the scenario of a missed connection, as many policies in this regard will only give you a limited amount in very limited circumstances. I will keep you all posted. ------- Sydney\n",

In past years when I traveled domestically first class for business with my employer paying the fare , it was NOTHING like this. Airlines, and service have come a long way, Never could I imagine this experience. I remember boarding in the back, under the tail, and walking up the aisle, and using a pillow for a tray....Ahhh, and now sleeping pods, pajamas, slippers, 5 star meals, top shelf spirits and the most polite incredible flight attendants, obviously the creme de la creme..

That is why I was so glad to hear Pres Obama himself proclaiming the wonderful advances in passenger processing at DFW for US Citz plus anyone travelling with ESTA. Therefore I was horrified by the 3hrs line up yesterday at DFW, making hundreds miss their connections (I had booked a 4hr connection - so we made it). The reason for the lines? 3 booths out of 28 were open. 1hr later they opened 16 more. Yes, there were 6 international flights landing within 20 mintues of each other, but in this day and age they must surely be fully aware of the number of passengers on each flight, their nationalities and their exact arrival time - many hours in advance. And to think we travelled via DFW in order to avoid LAX - not next time we wont Rant over !\n",

      "Some of you may remember my post from last year: tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g1-i10702-k64972… The thread appears to have been frozen, however I resurrect it now to give you an update ... Until last week I hadn't flown from CWL since the incident in the previous thread, but last Monday once again my contact lens solution was selected at for testing ... Once again, the staff were polite and professional - but this time I was prepared! My regular \"explosive\" solution was in my checked luggage, and in my hand luggage I was just carrying a 100ml bottle of solution that Specsavers said shouldn't test positive - and they were right. It passed the swab test and I was allowed to take it with me. In all the years I've been travelling I have never had contact lens solution tested at any other airport (apart from once in Bilbao, when they suspected it was something totally different - but that's another story ...), but maybe this will help anyone travelling through Cardiff with contact lens solution in their hand luggage - they seem to be on the lookout for it (I was assured I was simply chosen at random, though I'm sure I spotted a look of glee in the security staff eyes when they saw the bottle going through the X-ray machine ...). For clarification, the solution that tested positive was Specsavers' Easyvision Allpurpose solution; the \"safe\" solution is the Easyvision Multipurpose. If anyone needs a 100ml bottle, they have a stock in Specsavers in Queen Street Cardiff ;-)\n",

We're flying British Airways from LHR to Singapore, but our connecting flight is on Jetstar, and as we have quite a long time between flights in Changi (12 hours), we would like to make use of the transit hotel. However, as we will not be checked in from London straight through to Bali, we will have to reclaim our bags from the BA flight and then check in to the Jetstar one. As far as I can tell, both airlines use Terminal 1. My question is: will we be classed as transit passengers and therefore be able to use the transit hotel? My concern is that we will have to clear immigration in order to collect our bags, but then find that we are stuck landside and unable to use the hotel because check-in for our Jetstar flight to Bali doesn't open until several hours after our flight from London arrives. If anyone could put my mind at rest I'd be most grateful - thank you!\n",

      "Hi there I booked a holiday through Thomascook.com for my wife and I to fly to Kenya in October. This was scheduled to be flying with Monarch Airlines. When I received my confirmation - I noticed I was charged £20.00 per person for an extra 5kg of baggage - taking my total UP TO 20kg!!! Is that all????? Having looked at the Monarch Airlines website - all passengers flying to Mombasa are allowed a baggage allowance of 35kg PER PASSENGER. If you booked Premium Class this went up to 45kg PER PASSENGER!! I've been in touch with them and they refuse to budge! I've since cancelled my holiday with them and booked through Cosmos and got exactly the deal I was after..... 3 weeks in Kenya to look forward to, and 45kg of luggage each. This will enable us to take extra clothing to distribute among the local population as we did in 2005. Dave Hill\n",

Afterwards, we found out that even if you have a recent flight with NW and your miles would not expire for quite a while, the Delta expiration date does not get changed. We are now facing a very short time to use our Delta Sky Miles or we loose them. If we had known that, we would not have merged them. Just another sad case of loosing our favorite airline in a merger. We lost TWA, which for us was a great airline until American destroyed it in the merger.

Their latest ploy of charging for baggage to be put in the hold, when the current hand baggage legislation size rules are very tight, is a bit of a cheek. Then you get the CEO pretty much admitting that he doesn't want passengers sleeping on his planes so he is able to get his staff to seel them as much duty free/food/scratchcards as possible. With BA and other better quality European airliners reducing their prices, I wonder if the middle class who have embraced Ryan Air, will start being happy to pay a few quid more and fly with a bit more sophistication.\n",

The service I have received by them in the last 24h has been absolutely appalling. After a cancelled flight I was made to wait for almost 4 hours to be attended, at which time any options for rebooking has already left or were full.

With the rising cost of fuel the airline has found ways of reducing the fuel bill by reducing the weight it carries on its flights. They will be shrinking the size of its in-flight magazines from A4 to A5 size, carrying less ice on flights and believe it or not, \"encouraging\" staff to watch their weight - with the motivation of appearing in the annual Ryanair calendar! But Ryanair are only following in the foot steps of other airlines ... In the 1980's, American Airlines claimed that they saved $40,000 by taking out one olive from every salad in first class and more recently, Japanese airline All Nippon Airways started asking passengers to go to the toilet before boarding in a bid to reduce carbon emissions!

The paper says \"passengers trying to board flights at (New Delhi's) Indira Gandhi International Airport have fainted or have had epileptic fits due to the claustrophobic conditions prompted by construction work that has led to the closure of large chunks of areas, airlines operating from the airport have said. The airport — in the midst of a massive facelift — has shrunk considerably, leading to serpentine queues that regularly delay flights. People have missed their flights as they spend hours first battling a gut-crushing rush at the airport's entrance and then the immigration counters during the peak travel season.\" Construction is scheduled to end in April.\n",

Ideally, we would love to get these seats when we travel to Bangkok (economy) - although I know there is no guarantee and after reading posts they can be allocated to passengers with 'elite' status etc I believe these seats are only assigned by the airport check in staff on the day (or at least this is what I thought I read on the Emirates website).

Current best option by far is Austrian Airlines to Tokyo via Vienna. However the flight only has a transfer time of 45 mins at Vienna airport which leaves very little room - having never been to Vienna airport or flown with Austrian Airlines I don't know whether this is likely to be an issue? There is an alternative earlier flight to Vienna but unfortunately it's at 6am which means no sleep, an expensive transfer to the airport and a 4 hour wait at Vienna which significantly lengthens the flight. So no a very attractive alternative all round! Any thoughts appreciated.\n",

      "Our son lives in Atlanta and from time to time we get our grandchildren to come visit us in Florida. They have been flying in and out of Orlando on Air Tran. Now this is NOT a rant post against Air Tran but I am going to start flying them on Delta out of Melbourne. Reason being that the last two times we went to Orlando the service was so slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow that they missed the booked flight. Their luggage made it A ok but it took so long to get me a gate pass after they were checked in that we did not get to the gate in time. The problem seems to be two fold. First of all there are NOT enough agents to handle the load. Second is that you must stand in a line that is at the very end of the ticketing area and do not have a dedicated agent to deal with. So you must wait until another line is empty or another agent comes from the \"back\" to assist you. Maybe it is just Orlando and not Air Tran but I have never had any of those problems flying from Melbourne. Additionaly the security at Orlando is poorly organized and the TSA agents are in no hurry to get you to the airside on time. That is NOT the case in Melbourne as they are expediant and professional at all times.\n",

      "I appreciate that there are still alot of stranded people out there and I hope you all get home soon. but here was our story. I thought it best to wait 'till we all got home so we can give hopefully a balanced perspective of events. We were due to fly home on 15th April, when it all first happened from Atlanta. We were about 250 miles from the airport, just waking up in our hotel room when we heard the news on CNN, and obviously devastated. It was more the \"not knowing\" than anything else. The website (BA) told us not to go to the airport, and it was about 2.5 hours to speak to someone on the phone. We had to go and return the rental car anyway at ATL so had some hours to calm down and think a bit, rather than turn up to check in totally unaware and panic. The news in the U.S on this was fairly low key at the time from what we saw, and we got more information by logging on to UK news websites, it really felt like doom and gloom from what the media were saying. On our arrival at check in, we handed in my pre printed boarding passes to the BA check in staff, and decided just to book ourselves on the next available flight out, which was 6 days later. Again feeling devastated by the wait and potential additional expense that wasn't budgeted for (or so we thought). The kids were upset, the wife too, however \"keep calm\" I said to myself, trying to hold it all together ,as there is nothing you can do. BA check in staff were truely exceptional, along with ATL dispatchers for the flight (BA226 ATL-LHR on 15th Apr '10). Although they could not doing anything about the flight, their service went beyond the call of duty in terms of help, advice, and being put up in a hotel nearby with all meals paid for. BA, the hotel staff, ATL staff, and the British Consulate in downtown all worked together for the benefit of the passengers. All of them worked 110% to help us, and it will never be forgotten. I was aware of the other horror stories from other airlines just \"dumping\" their passengers with little more than $7 per day to survive on. We remember a group of 4/5 parent helpers looking after 20 or so kids who were representing the UK in a robotic tournament in Atlanta flying on an American airline who had to start paying out of their own pockets. I hope you got back safely if you're reading this. We also rememberd at the consulate, another passenger \"dumped\" by another European airline, with no one to talk to, speak to, or given any advice until the Consulate stepped in. There are hundreds more I know, and we are lucky to be what I think are the fortunate few who flew on BA. I'm not one to hype up BA, as I had some reservations on flying with them, but after this experience, and if I ever decide to fly again then there will only be 1 airline to choose from. I hope everyone can receive some form of recompense. Up to then my faith in British society had been strained to say the least, but this experience is something I'll never forget, that yes there are people out there who care and want to make a difference. I hope everyone out there still gets home safely and quickly.\n",

      "Hi, As information for any US passport holder or future applicant. New passport fees will become effective from 13 July 2010 onward. This is for all applications lodged *on or after* this date. Remember if you use a passport acceptance office (like a US post office) or one of the regional Department of State Passport Offices, it's the date on which you actually file or submit your application that will determine the fee matrix. If you are eligible to, and use regular US Mail for submission, it's the post mark date that will govern. Note that the one of the biggest increases (expressed as percentage) is in the additional page insert fee, which goes from *free* to $82 per insert added. Here's the entire new fee matrix from the DoS' Passport Services page: travel.state.gov/passport/fees/fees_5079.html If your passport is going to expire soon, will have less than 6 months validity, or you need to add extra pages, this would be an *excellent* time to do so, before the new fee matrix becomes applicable.

      "Yesterday I flew home from Jeddah via Doha on Qater Airways. On boarding the flight from Doha to Manchester it was quite chaotic in the forward economy cabin of the Airbus A330. Numerous families had unilaterally decided to seat themselves together regardless of their seat assignments. The poor FA spent 15 mins trying to get people into their correct seats. I reserved my usual aisle seat, but I had now been moved into a central aisle seat rather than my usual window aisle seat. I would hazard a guess this occurred to try and keep a family on the same row if possible, no big deal to be honest. However in my row was a mother and 2 children. The father of the family demanded rather than ask that I change seats with him, now if he'd been seated in business then fair enough, even accounting for his rather rude attitude. However he was seated in a centre seat behind me, I told him sorry but I dislike to being trapped in. He then became extremely rude, at which point I reported him to the FA. The FA had a word with him and he went off in Huff to his seat. Several hours later his young son looked at me and said \" your the nasty bl@@dy man who wouldn't move\" I guess that comment says it all really, clearly such language shouldn't come from a 3 yr old child. I have moved before to try and assist a family, as long as it's a similar seat close by then that's fine. This rather rude incident will definitely give me pause for thought in future. I think it was the overriding rude sense of entitlement that annoyed me. Regards Rick\n",

      "The reason of this email is to explain an unfortunate situation, me and other 10 passengers suffered at the Denpasar Airport on the 19 of December 2015. We arrived at the Denpasar airport, 19 of December 2015 with the flight VA65 from Sydney. Virgin. Now, we went to the transit Area in Denpasar and ask for Qatar Airways assistance. Nobody was there to do the checkin for transit passengers. We requested assitance to the airport personnel, but they did not help at all and told us that I we did not want to loose the connection flight, we had to do custom clearance, get our luggage and do the check in again at the Qatar desk. The personnel of the airport was disrespectful and with a total lack of customer service attitude. We had little time to decide and we finally made to the check in counter of qatar at the airport. When we did the check in, we were charged 200.000 rp which I think is completely wrong. 1) The airport tax was included in my ticket as the regulation changed on February 2015, Denpasar Airport tax was included , as I booked my flight during Sept 2015. 2) We were passenger in transit that did not get any help from Qatar or airport personnel and we wanted to take our flight. Passengers in transit should not pay the 200.000 rp. So, for the above stated, and because it was Qatar airways the carrier collecting the money, I am requesting the refund of it as I paid it twice. Another point to have in mind, right now I am at the Denpasar airport again, as a transit passenger, I arrived from Doha with Qatar airways and I am connecting to Sydey with Virgin. Virgin personnel was waiting for us on the transit counter of the airport of Denpasar, we did the check in and we did not pay for anything. So Virgin did his part on this situation, and Qatar did not.\n",

I've avoided this airline for so long, because everybody I know told me to basically avoid Aeroflot unless absolutely necessary. I'm looking for a decent ticket for my fly between North Europe and Tokyo. The cheaper the better when it comes to price, but flight duration is more important to me. I just looked up and the fastest is with either Aeroflot or Finnair for this route. But there is a huge price difference (Aeroflot is offering one-way tickets for 1/3 of Finnair's price). My dilemma is that other routs are much longer than these. I don't want to have a layover in Continental Europe because that becomes a detour. But Finnair's prices are more expensive than other airlines that offer flights from Europe to Tokyo. I'm debating if it's safe to fly with Aeroflot... I've seen comments that say it's not that bad any more. But then again, I hear horrific stories. If you've flown with Aeroflot recently, I'd love to hear your story, especially between Moscow-Tokyo.

      "Think twice if you are travelling to the Maldives with Thomson. We were delayed 22hours last week and were late arriving at Male. We are both airline crew so were wise to the excuses they gave. They basically blamed snow, Spanish ATC and fog at Gatwick, all of which were lies! The airline were most unhelpful and had no reps at any point during the delay and lied to us about the reason for the heavy delay. Thomson couldn't even send a rep the next day to the Gatwick Hilton hotel with details of our departure time and on our return we should have been given a letter stating a technical problem for the delay not all the lies originally given. Despite asking for an address to write to for compensation via the rep in the Maldives she failed to give us a letter on why the delay happened, which we were entitled to and had to get a copy of this via a kind passenger. Because of the dishonesty and the fact they were spineless to confront their passengers we won't be using them again.

Thomsons declined stating it was extra ordinary circumstances. Basically the flight from Majorca was delayed because the flight into majorca was delayed due to ongoing planned roundworks near to the airport causing \"some staff and passengers to be late for the outgoing flight\". These roadworks had been ongoing for more than 2 weeks prior to the date and therefore all staff/passengers should have been aware of the possibilities of delays and allowed extra time. The flight was also n a Sunday evening so this should have not been as much of a problem as it would have been at peak traffic times. After they declined my daughter wrote to the Spanish aviation authority and they agreed and advised compensation should be paid to the amount of é400 per passenger. Thomsons still refused and have refused to answer any further communication. She did all the communication via the online form - should we send in one last letter by post or should we proceed to the small claims court and in our opinions do you think she has a good chance of succeeding with the compensation claim.\n",

      "British Airways has refused to reimburse us (wife and I) for expenses we incurred due to their cancellation of our flight. They offered $150 travel voucher each. Our costs are $470.44. We arrived at LHR at 10AM on May 24, 2013. BA advised that all flights were now canceled until 4PM. That meant our 3PM flight to CPH was canceled. We stood in line at BA Customer Service for ten hours, along with hundreds of others. Customer Service only opened 4 windows. As the hours crawled by - tempers flared. We got to the window at 8PM. No flights available this day, nor the next day - that would get us to CPH in time for the evening sailing of our cruise ship. We agreed to an 10AM standby for CPH, and a alternative code share routing that would get us close to the port where the ship would be on the second sailing day. We spent the night wandering Heathrow Airport, and retrieved our checked luggage. Not much sleep. Next morning - no luck at Standby. Rushed to the alternate plan - and flew up to Manchester UK. Then - rushed to another terminal to partner Lufthanza for a flight to Munich Germany. From there, Lufthanza toHamburg - where we arrived at midnight of May 25 - on a weekend night - without a hotel reservation. Taxied to a hotel (very lucky) and got a few hours sleep. May 26 - off to the train station: took train to Rostock, them S-bahn to Warnemunde. Hurray - that is where our cruise ship was now docked. We made it - No Thanks to British Airways - to whom we had submitted all our documentation. And - to be clear about all this: We are requesting Nothing for the Ten hours we futilely stood in line, for the stress and aggravation, for the no sleep, no food at the Heathrow airport. I think it is shameful that British Airways would subject their customers to such treatment - then, simply dismiss a polite request for reimbursement.\n",

I booked her ticket under the name shown on her Passport and Visa, we'll use Jane Doe. Her ticket is also booked under Jane Doe. However, shortly after booking the ticket she told me that she had her named in her passport to Jane Doe *my last name*. So her ticket is booked under Jane Doe. Her Passport says \"Jane Doe\" Her Visa says \"Jane Doe\" But when they turn to the next page, they'll see a \"Change of Name\" sticker reflecting the legal change to \"Jane Doe + my last name\". My question is, will she still be allowed to fly and/or should we expect major problems during our trip over this?\n",

We ordered train tickets over the phone for a specified time (12:45pm) and got on the trian only to find out that we were given the wrong boarding passes (2:45pm). We noticed this after a request to show our tickets half-way enroute to London. The conductor on that train was so rude and didn't listen to any of our complaints and ended up slapping us in the face with a fine of 101 British pounds ($190) each with my travel compainion. Our efforts to discuss the matter with Virgin trains were turned away. On the same car another lady had the same problem but was welcomed with police at the train station in Euston because she failed to pay the fine. We had tickets and it wasn't our fault that we had boarded the train at the wriong time- in my opinion! To be fined extra fees yet the train had extra empty seats left a lot to be desired.

      "I have recently switched to Clear Care, a hydrogen peroxide based contact lens solution, due to my eye care professional's recommendation. In a few months, this will be my first time traveling with it (by air). I have been hearing stories of TSA officers confiscating such solution in carry on baggage and not being able to negotiate citing medical necessity as a reason, even when the bottle is in compliance with the 3-1-1 limitation. The reasoning is that hydrogen peroxide can potentially be used as an explosive. I am wondering what people's experiences are with this? I have always known that it is best to have enough of your contact lens care material in your carry on baggage in case your checked baggage gets delayed. However, I now use exclusively Clear Care, and if that does not make it through TSA, I will be left with nothing upon arrival if my checked baggage gets delayed. I am planning to travel to an Asian destination, where there is almost no guarantee that I will be able to find the product for sale.

I tried to complain several times before my travel and even trying to rearrange flights etc and there was no help anywhere so I bascically had to put up and shut up. My issue was I saved money up for a while to be able to treat my mum to a little break away (personal reasons). I booked through low cost holidays iv had holidays through them before with no issues but this time when booking I specifically chose the return flight with Thomas cook and paid a considerable amount more to return with them as theirs was a later flight. After a couple of months I had another email confirmation through as Thomas cook had rescheduled their flight which was 7 hours earlier than the original time and also earlier than other flights I could of chose and paid less for! this resulted in us losing near enough a day off our holiday and also losing out on the extra money I spend choosing to fly with them. Ive tried to complain to low cost holidays but they say its not down to them so my complaint should be to Thomas cook but then when I try to complain to Thomas cook its void as I didn't book with them directly so I basically cant complain to them. Is their a higher body in which I could complain to as this seems to just be a vicious circle and I'm not getting anywhere?\n",

A 7+ hour flight with a family of 4 behind me. The kids were an infant maybe 4 months old and a 2 year old. The kids alternated crying, screaming, howling and seat kicking the entire flight. Parents did nothing to stop this. Directly beside across the aisle were 2 parents with Junior lap baby that looked way to big to be a lap baby. Just before the lunch service Dad decided he was going to change Junior's very soiled diaper right there in the seat. From my vantage point, I could both see and smell everything that was going on. Absolutely vile. Needless to say, I was shocked. Just before landing, round # 2. The parents just rolled up the used diapers and placed them under the seats! The aircraft bathrooms had diaper changing tables too! A lack of class by these parents. Wondering if anyone else has witnessed such rude behavior lately while flying?

Now I didn't have a very hot curry the night before so knew it was not me. I began to think there was something wrong with the plane. Airbus 319's can sometimes make strange noises. Some of my fellow passengers were looking at me very strangely. Turns out that they guy behind me had one of those little dogs which look like a gremlin in a tiny dog carrier under my seat. It continued to yelp incessantly for about 45 minutes. You wouldn't think a little dog could squeal so loud. It wasn't really a bark, more like it was trying to squeal and bark at the same time. Most people around the area reached for their headphones including me but even that could not mask the little tyke out. Was not until I got up for my headphones and mentioned that the dog seemed distressed and that perhaps he should try to calm it down that he picked the poor thing from under the seat. He seemed oblivious to the noise it was making, perhaps he was immune. Give me a screaming child over this little begger any day ;-)\n",

The direct route via Lima came in at around $780... more expensive than flying on to Easter Island.

What are the latest thoughts on refusing to switch seats,especially when there's retaliation? My flight last night from JFK-FRA on Lufthansa was PACKED,and I guess a lot of people had their seats screwed up(so the pilot said as we were taxiing to the runway). I was on an aisle of a 4 seat section,and the guy next to me asked if I would switch with his wife,who was in the row ahead of us,in a middle seat. I declined,as I tend to be a somewhat anxious flyer(i dont show it,but I do need aisle access) and i reserved my seat 2 months ago. The guy was disgusted of course(the guy on the aisle seat next to the wife must also have refused) and proceeded to sit the entire flight with his legs in a V-position,leaving his left leg halfway under the seat in front of me.He also threw his blanket all over him so that it came into my seat(which i picked up and put over the side of his armrest-no fuss,just removed it from my lap) and stood in the aisle when i went to the restroom once and refused to let me back into my seat b/c \"he needed to stand.\" I could have went to an FA,but it was a 6 hour flight and I didnt want any more issues. Plus I knew there was nowhere else to be moved. Thoughts?? Also,it was definitely a rude guy flight-the passenger in front of me reclined his seat ALL the way back(which is their right,I know,so i did the same)and complained to me that I was bumping the back of his seat everytime I moved around in my seat or got into my bag(which I did once or twice). I did tell him that if he pulled his seat forward he might not notice me as much,but he kept it where it was. Needless to say,the flight was just peachy. Lufthansa was fine,though,service was good despite the passengers. We had in seat entertainment,decent food,plenty of beverage service and free alcohol. Anyway,feedback is appreciated. ------\n",

      "I recently booked Ryanair flights for my husband and his friend. When I began the online check in, I realised the surname of the second adult, the friend, was wrongly entered as the same surname as my husband although his first name was correct. I had failed to notice this on the confirmation email. Rang Ryanair and they said it would cost £160 for them to change the name or £110 if we did it ourselves online. As the hotel was booked, we had little choice but to pay the £110. Protests that the mistake was not ours fell on deaf ears. I wrote to their head office but they refused to be of any assistance. Some googling showed that others had experienced a reversion of the second adult surname to that of the first adult when the website goes to the payment page. I believe this is what happened to us. It also appears their terms of contract may be considered unfair. So I intend to sue them in the county court and wondered if anyone might have any experiences of doing this with Ryanair?\n",

      "I booked and paid for a flight on CheapoAir between 2 European cities. Later that day, I saw the carrier offering the same flight, class, limitations on their own website for literally more than 2/3 LESS than what I paid. I provided all the necessary documentation to CoA as instructed under their \"Lowest fare guarantee'. They denied my claim because the carrier's website 'is not a US website'. They cite the lack of a US customer service number as a basis. (Note that an effort to use CoA's US phone number resulted in a 53 minute wait, followed by a disconnect, so I had to use online chat anyway.) I don't see the relevance, other than to contrive a way to not meet their advertised promises, However, it gets worse. CoA sent me a hotel coupon to use in conjunction with my (disputed) flight. I decided to use it to shave my loss. Found the hotel I wanted on the dates I needed. I provided all the information including full credit card data. Agreed to CoA terms, hit Confirm, and received a confirmation of - ANOTHER FLIGHT! Nothing about a hotel., No email confirm. Nothing. Now, forced to endure the one hour phone wait, I spoke to a representative who claimed that AmEx had rejected the charge. I called Amex and they denied that. Lie # 1. The CoA rep (still on the phone) told me she would book it directly, but after several minutes, told me the hotel had sold out, and would I like to book somewhere else? That is Lie # 2, because I promptly went to (very reliable) Hotels.com and successfully booked exactly what CoA had originally offered at the same (pre-coupon) price. I also confirmed the booking with the hotel itself. I've booked many air and hotel tickets with CoA, and never had a problem. However, I also never tried to do anything even slightly out of the ordinary, like use a coupon or rely on a guarantee, This is a trust business. Buh-Bye, CheapoAir,\n",

      "Since Usairways merger with American our service and prices have suffered out of Charlotte. My last experience made me vow to never fly them unless I absolutely had to. My wife and I just returned from a round trip via Delta from Charlotte to Jacksonville, FL. We flew first class cheaper than a coach seat on AA. From the moment we stepped up to the ticket counter in Charlotte until we got our baggage back at the end of the trip, it was amazing to experience the difference in service. The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing. Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat, fresh blankets, pillows, and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground, and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles. Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings. The entire crew was dressed very sharply, smiled, and actually thanked us for flying with them. They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service. Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crews....it is common place on AA. It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable. On each leg of the trip, our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim. AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutes. Best decision we've made to switch our business to Delta.\n",

Once in Minneapolis we were told by Delta that we did not have reservations to fly to Fargo , even though the ticket we received did show a flight , we were then told to see a United ticket agent , and that was in a different terminal . Well off i went , unfortunately the first agent i found was on the phone , he proceeded to tell me , by putting his hand on receiver that he will be on the phone for awhile , i then grabbed my TICKETS and proceeded to the next gate , still not knowing whether we had a flight . The next terminal had an agent dealing with a client , 2 other people were standing just behind the gate having an animated conversation , after 10 mins 1 left and went back to original United gate ..The agent was off the phone , looked at my tickets , reprinted them and said YOU DO have reservations for that flight , go see delta . Off i went to delta again , different terminal again , I was again told by Delta we did not have reservations and I need to go back to United !!!!!!!!!!! At this point I was probably I step away from loosing it , the agent then offered me the United PHONE NUMBER !! ..... After some enormous restraint I insisted she call !! She told me to have a seat , finally I i overheard her mention they had marked an HL or something on the ticket or reservation !!! I have no idea what that meant , shortly after she called us up and asked for our identification !!! we received or tickets and proceeded to our gate ... c 9 then c 10 and then f 1 .... We were a party of 4 , 2 of witch are mid 70 senior citizens , in the 13 hours it took , every time we had to bounce from terminal to terminal they went with us , this was very stress full on them , we had originally boarded united in vegas Friday flight 6659 friday ..I have not checked my credit card statement but we had 2 rooms booked for late check in 130 am saturday morning in Fargo ,ND , as Fargo was not our final destination , so i may find i have been charged for these rooms as well .

      "I recently returned from 3 weeks in Europe after flying with BA a few times and just wanted to share my experiences I had with the airline. ---- from YVR to LHR: Departed on time, arrived at LHR 20 minutes early. I paid about $100 extra for an exit row seat (28J) and couldn't recommend this more. The seat is located in the first row in Economy, right behind Club World. After takeoff, they close the curtain and due to there being no toilets here, there's no one walking around to disturb you. My seat was right beside the door which kind of protrudes out. This was used as my leg rest for the entire duration of the flight. If you can't afford Premium Economy, this is a really great option. Dinner was a choice of pasta (with feta and tomatoes) or chicken (with rice and veggies). I had the pasta which was actually quite tasty - by no means a five star meal, but not bad for plane food. The chocolate dessert was delicious. After dinner service, lights went out and it was time to sleep. A word of warning - it's extremely cold by the exits. I had a blanket and jacket but I was still shivering throughout the entire flight. In hindsight, I'm not sure why I didn't ask for an extra blanket - I must have been delirious with sleep... Breakfast is served about an hour before landing. It consisted of a fruit muffin, yogurt, and a box of raisins (?!). Not very filling, but oh well. IFE was average - I only watched one movie before going to sleep. The new releases were nothing to get excited about, so it may be wise to bring your own entertainment. BA85 from LHR to YVR: My experience on this flight was similar to the above, except this time I had seat 29K. This is also an exit row seat but in the second row of economy with a missing seat in front which allows you to enter the aisle by walking in front (and not over your seat mates). It was a good seat but not as good as any of the exit row seats in row 28 which just feel more spacious. This flight departed a bit late and arrived 45 minutes late at YVR. I also flew from LHR to BCN (BA486), and AMS to LHR (BA435) on their smaller planes. Both plane interiors looked brand spanking new. I managed to score exit row seats on both these fights as well which was a nice bonus even though the flights were quite short in duration. There's no IFE but they do serve a small snack and free drinks on both flights. I don't know what the snacks were as I declined them on both flights. Overall, a very good experience with BA. They're definitely my airline of choice when flying to, from, and within Europe, especially if I can get an exit row seat on the international flights. Edited: 11:28 pm, July 13, 2015\n",

Departing around the 20th December and returning around the 12th January. Do you know if there will be any sales for this time period or chances of flights dropping in price? Reading forums already posted, I will be sticking to purchasing directly from airline carriers. To many dodgy and expensive travel agencies and third parties out there.\n",

The first agent (Kay) had me on hold for over an hour then never returned. Total wait time 1 hour 15 minutes. Second agent (Lloyd) said he changed the reservation and updated the itinerary and would email it to me. Total wait time 45 minutes. He emailed the cancelled intinerary and did not save the new updated itinerary. Third agent (so frustrated I forgot her name). She states that there is no reservation and only 2 of the 5 new flights are in the notes. She states that they could not make the reservation and that I should call back on Monday for reservations. Total wait time 30 minutes. If I did not have a $1372.20 credit.....oh by the way, I had to pay $700 in cancellation fees to use the credit, I would never ever use them again.\n",

      "Hold on to your hand luggage if you are travelling to South Africa on British Airways. Any domestic travel included in your ticket will probably be on South African airline Comair, operating under the British Airways banner. BA/Comair has a “policy” (it happened on both of my flights) of selecting passengers at random and asking them to leave their hand luggage at the door when boarding, as “the cabin is full”. Don’t do it. I did, and had a phone stolen from my bag. When the crew approached me at the door, I asked them if they would stow the bag on board, meaning in the cabin. They said they would. Instead, I ended up collecting my unlocked bag of valuables (minus one) from the carousel in the terminal. To add insult to injury, my bag was well within the regulation size, it fitted comfortably into the overhead locker (on the return trip) and it was all unnecessary as there was plenty of room in the lockers anyway. When I complained to BA at the airport I was told I should not have left valuables in my checked-in luggage! Had I not been so sleep deprived after a long international flight I might have been more circumspect when ambushed by the crew. BA/Comair has not responded to any of the three emails I have sent them. So much for me being accommodating.\n",

      "A Qantas Boeing 747 traveling from London \"lost power from all four of its main generators 15 minutes away from Bangkok, and the pilot was forced to switch to battery back-up for the landing,\" The Sydney Morning Herald reports. The Australian newspaper says the Monday incident \"is set to prompt a worldwide alert to Boeing 747 operators after the problem was traced to a cracked drip tray under the first-class galley.\" In a story from this morning, the Morning Herald says \"water from the blocked drain collected in a drip tray under the floor. A crack in the drip tray caused the water to leak into electrical wiring. Each of the plane's four engines has its own generator, but the water shorted out the aircraft's power supply.\" David Cox, Qantas' executive general manager responsible for engineering, tells The Australian \"it was just like tipping a glass of water into your stereo.\" Dr. Arvind Sinha, director of aerospace at RMIT University in Melbourne, explains to the Morning Herald that \"the engines have their own independent power source and the steering is operated by a hydraulic pump system, but the critical issues are the navigation and communication systems that you need to find your way to a runway to land.\" Colin Adams of the Australian and International Pilot's Association says the Qantas crew and passengers were \"lucky\" that the plane was not far out over open water when the incident occurred, according to the London Daily Mail. \"In that situation you have a minimum of 30 minutes before you lose power to the flight instruments,\" Adams tells the Morning Herald. \"After that the only idea that you have of airspeed and where you are in relation to what's around you is what you can see out of the window. There is no written procedure for what happens in that situation -- it's the pilot and his wits. If you were a long way from an airfield at night it would be an extremely hazardous situation. If you were in cloud you would not know where the ground was and you could end up in an extremely dangerous situation.\" The 747-400 is now back in service for Qantas, according to The Associated Press. \"As a precaution, Qantas has inspected its entire B747-400 fleet and all of these aircraft have been cleared to fly,\" Qantas executive John Borghetti tells The Telegraph of London.

      "EasyJet have announced they will close their base in Madrid this October, pulling all eight aircraft out and redeploying them elsewhere across Europe. Although only 20% of services will be lost within the next year, EasyJet are still selling tickets as normal through the winter season with no route or frequency cuts at all other than Manchester and schedules still show early morning departures and late night arrivals in Madrid, which shows that aircraft is based there. Why are they still selling these flights when us who take only little interest in the aviation industry know they won't happen but others less so will not? I'd say for the time being people DO NOT BOOK EASYJET FLIGHTS TO/FROM MADRID POST OCTOBER 2012 AS THERE'S A CHANCE IT MAY NOT FLY! Give it a couple of weeks or so unless anything happens before hand. Anybody remember when they closed East Midlands flights? They sold them and people were booking them when EasyJet knew they wouldn't fly at that time. Same seems to be happening here!

Allegiant Flight was 45 minutes late taking off from Memphis because they were \"still loading baggage.\" We arrived in Las Vegas 1 hour past Arrival time. As we landed, the announcement was made to lower all window shades & place seat belts in seats, as the plane was scheduled to depart again quickly. Waited 45 minutes @ Baggage Claim. No bags. Passengers flooded Allegiant Office, where it was \"determined\" that the baggage was not in LAS, nor was it in MEM. & No there's not another flight from MEM today. Maybe tomorrow? By the time most had spent 20 minutes filling out Lost Luggage Forms, I (not one to give up easily) asked an Allegiant Associate if they were sure they had checked all possible cargo areas? @ This point, I'm thinking:: \"Surely they didn't put a whole flight's luggage on a plane to ???\" That would make no sense. It HAS to be HERE!!! She made a phone call:: \"Has anyone checked the middle cargo compartment?\" Held for a few minutes. Then \"Yaaaaaaay!!!!\" Duh . . . 1 more hour before we could retrieve it from the belt. So 2 hours 45 minutes of wasted gambling time.

Got up at 0530 this morning to get ready to go to the airport and had a text from Easyjet to tell me the flight was concelled. Blooming heck I said, or words t that effect, what am I going to do now? To top it off I forgot that they sent me a mail ages ago changing the flight to 1020 so not only have they cancelled I got up two hours early:-((((( Not blaming EZY for the horrendous snow but I tried to call customer services at 0600 and was on the phone for 30 mins before giving up. I wanted to see if I could change the flight to go to MAN then catch a train which you can't seem to do online, only reschedule the flight or get a refund. Anyway I have managed to get on KLM (€220 !) but not until 2100 tonight. There was a flight at 1500 but after procrastinating about what to do and hanging on the phone to Easyjet that quickly filled up as KLM also cancelled their morning flights to and from EDI. Moral of this story is don't hang about in these situations. Carpe diem and grab the next available flight before some other bugg3r does. Anyway will miss the meal but these things happen. Never had a flight cancelled before due to weather but it would have to be today of all days.At least EZY managed to let me know by text and e-mail BEFORE I left for Schiphol. By the way flgihts to Glasgow for the next few days were over €500 on KLM. I only wanted a seat not an executive jet!! Moan over ;-)\n",

      "I know Jetstar regularly get a slating for their delays and bad service, so thought it was only fair I shared the excellent experience we had with them recently. We flew Christchurch NZL to Narita Airport, Tokyo via the Gold Coast Airport. The flights were on time going over, no issues with delays or connections. The flight was delayed an hour coming back, but apart from that we had no issues with onwards connections, lost bags etc. The planes were lovely and service great. The thing that impressed us most was regarding our request to have luggage on the way back. We had booked a while back when they had a 2:1 special (2 fly for price of 1). We booked our basic flights ex Chch. Over the next few weeks we got several emails changing details of our flight. For the most part these were tiny changes: change of terminal, flights changing times by 5-10 minutes (in our favour), however, one of the changes was canning the return flight to Chch and putting us on a flight to Auckland, then a domestic flight to Chch. We didn't have any choice but to accept this as our trip was on quite a tight timeframe. Later we decided that we wanted to have one person with 10kg baggage on the way back to allow for a few souvenirs we planned to get. When we went to do this online, we found that it would cost us $98 (which we were prepared to pay) plus $15 more because of the domestic flight we now had through the change to their scheduling. We decided to wait until the airport and ask them there to waive the $15 as it was not our choice to do that leg. The lady at the airport counter spent quite a bit of time going through our booking history, then she handed us our boarding passes and said no problem. I pulled out my cc to pay for the Narita-AKL baggage and she said there was no charge for that either. We had asked for one person to have 10kg and she loaded 15kg baggage on both our tickets for free. We thought that was pretty good and were happy with that! When we got onto the Gold Coast-Auckland leg of our return flight we discovered we had exit row seats and then when the food trolley came round, the hostess informed us we each had $10 voucher for food. This was our first time flying long haul with a LCC. Even without the freebies we got as compensation for the change of return flight, we found it a good experience and would happily fly Jetstar long haul again out of NZ/Australia.\n",

The reality here, of course, is that there really is nothing unbusiness-like or underhanded, nor are there any \"bait and switch\" tactics in what these sites offer or what they charge as YOU authorize the total amount of charges which you agree to pay when you \"submit.\" It isn't worth complaining if YOUdon't exercise reasonable care -- and READ THE FINE PRINT beforehand -- when using such sites.

I bought (11/ 6/2006) three United Airline tickets ($1833 visa receipt is attached) from Cheapoair (internet site located in New York) to fly from San Francisco to Cancun on January 20th, 2007.

I have been trying to make new reservations for over three months now. At first I tried to use the credit to go to New York (see emails), now I have been simply trying to rebook my original itinerary (SFO to CUN).

They never do! I have cell phone record of hours of conversation time. I have also sent numerous emails, including a final warning that I would be filing a criminal complaint.

It is our honeymoon and we've purchased Premium Economy tickets. We're really hoping to sit together...and not in the middle of the 4-seat row. Thank you for your advice!\n",

      "Just wondering if anyone has experienced anything like this. We were booked onto a TAP flight from Heathrow to Lisbon, Lisbon to Miami in July 2015 as a party of 9. Two different groups applied for their Esta's. An email was received to say Authorised after the initial word on application said Pending. We could not book in online, it came up as check in at airport. We arrived at Heathrow at 02:30 for a 6am flight. The passport machine would not let us check in. We were directed to different desks around the airport, the final one being the Special Assistance desk. There was already a family with a problem at the desk and there was no senior members of staff to help us. We were told there was a problem with our Esta. We promptly got the Esta number up on our mobile devices but the check in staff said it was too late to book 9 people in and closed the flight!!! We were told to go to the ticket desk and buy new tickets! There was no staff from TAP airlines to help us. The manager eventually came back from the gate and agreed to talk to us. After much discussion we were booked on United flights the following day. Our party of 9 were split up into 5 and 4. 4 going first via Newark, then 5 going 5 hours later via Houston. They would not discuss how we wanted the party split resulting in my daughter's friend flying with our other family members. We were due to arrive in Miami on Sat afternoon but got there Monday morning. We were at Heathrow for 32 hours with children. Tap would not help us with a hotel, meals, nothing! We have a case open with the CAA but at this point TAP are saying we did not have the correct documents. We did have them and produced them, there was no-one to help us at Heathrow. We had no different documents on the Sunday when we were allowed to fly with United. Our argument is that there should have been someone there to help us. An immigration officer at the airport said our problem could have been sorted out by the airline in minutes. Has anyone got any advice on this? TIA ---\n",

At the time of our research at www.priceline.com, we were able to locate a lower fare of $(edited) per passenger.

      "My partner and I recently flew back from Barcelona to Heathrow with BA. The flight was delayed by 2.5 hours, resulting in our getting into Heathrow after midnight, when all public transport other than taxis had ceased running. During the flight, we were told on two occasions by crew that if passengers were to take a taxi home, this would be refunded in full by the airline on presentation of a receipt. On arrival, we received a quote from a London black cab for £85-90 to North London. This would normally be an excessive expense for us, but as it was 12.30am we took the taxi in order to get home quickly (and in the understanding that reimbursement would be forthcoming). The final fare ended up being £97. However, on making a claim and presenting our taxi receipt, we were informed by BA's Customer Relations department that we would only be refunded £50 as the full amount was considered 'beyond reasonable' and it would be 'unfair to other customers' to make an exception. After querying this further - and stressing that passengers were explicitly told that they would be 'fully' refunded for any taxi journeys - we finally learnt (via a response from the airline's Twitter account!) that the maximum compensation given for transport is £50. I wondered if any others have experienced something similar? I think it's fair to say that we and the other passengers were misled by BA, who promised something only to fail to deliver, leaving us considerably out of pocket. They also appear to be completely oblivious to the actual cost of a standard taxi from Heathrow to London! If anybody has any suggestions on alternative channels for proceeding with this, it would be much appreciated. I have already considered raising it with the CAA. ----\n",

Here it is: I have friends and family members who can't or won't be bothered to mail presents (and money is not the problem). They save them up for when I visit and then give them to me then, expecting me to take them back on the plane. Sometimes these gifts are quite bulky; and, as I travel lightly (almost always without checked luggage, and usually with just a back-pack), they never fit into my luggage. On one occasion I ended up checking my backpack to bring the present on board as a carry-on; on another occasion, a family member mailed me the present (and didn't tell the giver that she was doing this). I've kind of had it, and would frankly prefer not to receive anything rather than have to pay $25 to check luggage or put another family member out.

      "i fly with china airlines from Los angeles to taipei with connecting flight to jakarta almost 20 hours flight. it was a very dissapointed experience from my 20 years flying experience. i'm a travel addict, i will travel at least 2 times a year to all over the world, n i ve been used many airlines, from asian airlines, european, even from arabian airlines..but china airlines is the biggest dissapointment. their ground staff are mean..never smile, no cooperation at all..i've never seen someone in service business that never give a smile...even starbuck who sell a cup of coffee give a smile everytime they serve. i travel with two small childrens, i asked her nicely that, if possible can she gave me a four in a row seats so we can be seating together..she respond NO without looking or even try to look for the seats..so in the end i've to beg other passangers on the aircraft so we can be seated together and the stewardess do not bother to help me out with this. and after all my documents finished and i received my boarding passes , i said thank you to her but she didn't respond or look at me..just pretend to be busy. at the boarding gate they call for a traveller with a small children to be onboard before the rest, so like i usually do ,i came forward and show them my ticket and my children but alas they rejected me at the gate and said what they mean is children under 2 years old. what is wrong with this peoples, what is the differences between 2 years old and 4 years old children ? so that's it ! this will be my last flight with china airlines.. i call my travel agent and said to them not to offer me this airlines again, better offer me a twin otter plane from some village airlines than this so called four star airlines...they do not deserve it\n",

      "We have a few options at the moment in booking a Melbourne to London flight for Dec/Jan this year. Etihad had the best return fares but have disappeared at the moment, with the next best being Malaysian, followed closely by BA and Cathay Pacific. For single flights, we can get the same prices, flying over with Singapore and returning with Etihad, BA, or Qantas. The costs for the two one-way fares is pretty similar to the return fares. Up until today I was pretty sure we would go with the one way fares, mainly because Singapore has such a good name and we could then try (mixed reviews) Etihad on the way home, or Qantas if we wanted the old faithful. What changed today was that Cathay has come into the game with a very competitive return fare and I have heard that they are on a par with Singapore. If this is right, it would seem that taking the Cathay return fare would be the best option. Would love to hear any opinions from those who have comparisons or experiences with any of the above.

I planned to fly back after a week. Then my father-in-law died two days after Christmas. Now Access America is refusing my claim. This is outrageous. Access America refused my claim because my father-in-law's death was \"either known to you or likely to happen.\" I had no idea he was going to die when he did or I wouldn't have made the flight reservations in the first place. My husband and I are self-employed so one of us had to get back to the business. We couldn't both stay there for the days, weeks or months he might have lasted. When he passed away it became more important for me to stay with my husband. Now Access America is telling me my only recourse is arbitration, which involves a fee and court appearance.

      "I recently flew with Thomson and would never do so again. I flew with one checked bag at a meagre 20kg, and my usual hand luggage bag on wheels. All was perfectly fine on the way OUT (hand luggage was given a cursory glance and declared to be fine), but coming home was a different story. The officials at Crete weighed my hand luggage and found it to be overweight. I had NEVER had hand luggage weighed before, even on the Thomson flight out. I was sent to a different desk in order to check in my hand luggage as a second bag for the hold. I was told this would be €25 and begrudgingly agreed to this, pointing out that this had NOT been a problem on the way over for the SAME bag. Upon reaching the desk, I was told that ON TOP of the €25 I had to pay an amount per every kilo this bag weighed. I was presented with a total fee for checking in a very small hand-luggage sized bag, of....wait for it....€133! The staff were rude, dismissive and told me this was Thompson policy and the airline was rigorous in its baggage checks. This obviously only applies on your return flight, where you have no other option of leaving stuff, and struggle to understand the language and make yourself understood. I felt bullied and was reduced to tears. During discussion, I was told my flight was completely full - it was not. I was also told if I didn't pay up, the €133 would be taken from the pocket of the lady working on the Thomson desk! (really?!) There were other people queuing, all bitterly upset with the surcharges dumped on them for the return flight only. I eventually rectified the situation by donating my beach towels and books to Thomson, and wearing approx 4kg of my clothes, thus saving myself €133. Hideous end to a lovely week, all faith in Thomson GONE. PS credit to the amazing cabin crew staff who looked after me on the return flight - i could have hugged you all for your kindness.\n",

I thought I got a great deal ( never flown to nyc before and 360.00 seems like a steal) But now, im a little nervous. Maybe I've been reading too many reviews by 'difficult passangers' but I have heard : There is only free wifi on flights from sfo to jfk, all others must bay 13.00 usd most outlets don't work ( was a common complaint I've heard..) no free inflight drinks or snacks ( not even water?) inflight movies and ther entertainment are available for an undisclosed fee. Now, im not by any means a difficult passanger. I pay attention during the safety lecture, bring my own food and drinks as well as a book or two and most of all, I realize the flight attendants are there for safety and not to be a 'sky waitress' But after reading/ hearing all that I can't help but feel like I got a bad deal.

      "I travel on Firefly (the \"budget\" airline under Malaysian Airlines) for the convenience of flying out of Subang Airport. Recently, I opted for the 'taxi' booking to add on to my travel booking from the Firefly website. Let me tell you - NEVER opt for this. The airlines charged me MYR6 and it is really for no good reason and it was not explained clearly in the website. I was under the impression that \"for my convenience\" I could book a cab to get to the airport and this was the cab fare. It is not. It is merely to have the cab company call you to ask whether you need a cab!!! Which you can do for free on your own. So, in addition to the MYR6 you pay to the airlines, you will need to fork out the metered fare plus MYR10 (because you booked the cab as opposed to flagging it down at a cab stand). Do not get cheated by Firefly by opting for this \"taxi service\". I demanded a refund from Firefly and was promptly told I can complain by sending in an email to the airlines!!! How's that for service??!!\n",

      "I have been a Life Member of Qantas Club for years but generally, these days, choose other airlines. For all the smoke and mirrors, Qantas is very ho-hum , ergo, dull and boring. After a series of serious in-flight incidents, the proud kangaroo has had a bit of PR disaster. While Qantas has not had an accident/incident where people died, tarnished is the operative word for them. They are gradually whittling away any benefits at all. Recently I booked with their subsidiary, Jetstar, Sydney - Honolulu return with business options. Here, the add-ons they normally charge to go cattle are generally included. I have a cattle class Sydney-Brisbane return with them as well and that has add-on costs galore. My real beef is the dreadful Jetstar website and lack of connection with that of Daddy QANTAS. In spite of endless patience and a very fast Internet connection, the Jetstar site is woefully slow and has severe Alzheimer's! The site continues to insist that I have no booking for my international leg although I have a confirmed itinerary and a booking number: absolutely a denial that such a booking exists. A call to their customer service department took two days to get through! It kept ringing out or I got a number unreachable message. When I did connect, I was assured there was such a booking but not according to my profile. However, the domestic booking is there! Go figure! With well over 400,000 frequent flyer points, Qantas has a couple of reward options for flight redemptions but of course, taxes can be extreme so one might just as well buy a ticket anyway. To sum up, Qantas is a dead duck and I avoid them generally. My loyalty is focused elsewhere!\n",

      "I just called to clear the outstanding balance of 6 day trip to NY which cost my friend and I £400 EACH - bargain (or so we thought). When I called a few wks ago to pay of £590 I was informed that the airfare taxes had risen by £20pp. At the time of booking the agent who booked the holiday said it was possible that they would rise once before the o/b was paid off but not by much. I was a bit annoyed that I hadn't been called/emailed and informed of this, and that it was casually mentioned at the time of payment but I accepted it s I was told they need my \"ok\" before they could deduct the £590 off my card. I asked at least 3 times if the taxes would rise again and was told no repeatedly. All was fine and with the new £20pp tax fee ...my outstanding balance now stood at £64.90 and my friend's was £54.90. I called today (the last day to pay off the booking) to pay the final £119.80 and am told \"Oh it's £150 you owe madam and if it's not paid today you will lose the holiday\". I've had the worst week imaginable and completely lost my cool as I found it incredibly cheeky that they appeared to have plucked this sum out of the air as I had had my o/b confirmed to me repeatedly during the last phone call 3 weeks ago!! I disputed the o/b and went through the maths with the woman on the phone who couldn't understand what I was saying and was in a bloody call centre in India and who said that she'd escalate my complaint to a manager who'd call tomorrow...cue more ranting from me that today was the last day to pay the o/b and that a phone call tomorrow would be useless if she was saying that I'd lose the holiday if it wasn't paid off today. I asked to be transferred through to the sales team as she was in the customer services team and seemingly in a differennt country! After being put on hold for a while an English sounding guy came on the line, asking what the problem was..at this point I'm in tears as I'm so stressed out and he tells me \"You won't lose the holiday as you're talking to me now. You called us, it's fine. Your tickets have been dispatched anyway\". He says that the price of the holiday may have gone up and didn't I get any emails from the woman who booked it for me bk in October. I haven't heard from here since the day I bloody booked it!!!!!! I tell him how I was told that the taxes would not be rising again and how I'd budgeted down to the last penny for what I believed I owed. He gave me this agents direct line telling me she'd be in tomorrow 9:00-5:30pm and that she knew more about the booking and would be able to help me. I'm so angry at this shoddy service from Travelocity. You can't go adding money onto peoples outstanding balances without informing them beforehand!!! I lost my job recently so money is tight at the moment and to say I'm still shaking with anger is not an exaggeration! I was in bloody tears to the guy on the phone. I'm so stressed out at the moment. They can't do this again can they??? They'd have the call on tape where I was told in no terms would the taxes be rising again.. I wasn't even told by the lady in India where the additional £30 had come from!!!!!!!! Will be ringing the lady who booked the trip for me first thing tomorrow morning but would appreciate any advice if possible. Many thanks for reading my rant ....*and breathe*\n",

Emirates fare has increased today, from £511.00pp to £512.00pp Due to work commitments, Emirates BHX 20:35 departure is more beneficial as this saves having an extra day of work.

They did not contact us and when we got to the airport we found a phone at their counter and were told we were pretty much out of luck. They had not made alternate arrangements, nor could they help. We did not have the credit card we'd used for purchase and were told to call when we got home and they'd refund our money. We specifically asked if we needed to do anything else and were told all we needed was the credit card. Now that we're home they're saying we need to return the paper tickets that the other person was wrong. I find if ludicrous that they strand us and then try to shift responsibility to us for their mistake. We don't have the tickets, so we're supposed to talk to corporate. We've left messages 3 times now and no one is calling back. The only phone number on the website is to reservations and they will send a message, that goes unanswered.

That wasn't a big drama, but a bit annoying when you book through an agent for some service. The real problem started at the airport, we tried to check in but the airline had no record of our booking even though Orbitz had issued us paper tickets showing apparent valid ticket numbers. I tried to call Orbitz at the airport but by the time I finally got to speak to someone and have them understand that a) I was at the airport trying to check in b) No, i didn't want to cancel my booking and c) I am Australian, so my zip code has only 4 digits, we were forced to purchase new tickets at the airport to be able to board at a cost of around $250 before check-in close. Since the flight, I have tried to contact Alitalia about the issue, with no response whatsoever and Orbitz by email, who just say to call. When I call, I'm repeatedly put on hold (paying international call rates) and was told on the last call that \"Orbitz will not refund the tickets as the airline re-accommodated us on a later flight.\" They do not read my emails or listen to what I have to say (ie. we only got on the later flight after we purchased new tickets), just keep repeating the line that the airline put on a later flight. I don't want a refund for the original tickets, I want a refund for the more expensive tickets that we had to purchase at the airport! Any ideas of what else I can do? I'm sure we have some rights under the Montreal Convention but it's hard to make any claims when you get no response from the airline or incoherent, useless responses from the agent!\n",

      "Over the years Qantas has moved out of many regional routes and replaced their Qantas flights with Jetstar. I travel a lot to/from Sydney and use Jetstar 6+ times a month which of course always take off and land at T2 in Sydney. So, Qantas in its wisdom (or a sign of the economic times) has closed the Qantas Club Lounge at T2. A lot of us pay $450+ per year for a Qantas Club membership - if you cant fly Qantas (because they now fly Jetstar) the lounge in T2 was well worth it. Qantas say \"oh, just use the lounge in T3\" - well, easier said than done - you have to go through security at T3 to get to the Qantas lounge (ever done that at 7am in the morning), then leave T3 and go through security again at T2. Qantas say they haven't had very many complaints on this closure (have you ever tried to navigate the Qantas web site to find a complaint form?). I did then was sent an invite to join the American Express® Qantas Corporate Card program - what? Maybe if 1,000 people decide not to renew their Qantas Club membership then the loss of $450,000 might create a rethink in the halls of power and they will reopen a (smaller) T2 Qantas lounge. Yeah, maybe not. In any event if you agree and think this is a bad decision please post to this forum topic. Ill be happy to let Qantas know.\n",

      "Dear Readers I recently (June and July2010) travelled to Europe from Australia with my wife and 3 children aged 16,11 and 9. We visited France, Greece and England. I booked and paid for 3 flights with Easy Jet prior to our departure. The first two flights were uneventful. However our last flight from Athens to London ended up blowing my holiday budget out of the water. We were booked on an Olympic Air flight out of Paros in the Greek Islands a flight that is 20 minutes in length and was scheduled to depart at 16.05pm. Our Easy Jet Connection was due to depart at 19.00 and check in closed at 18.20. Due to the late incoming plane to Paros we did not arrive in at Athens airport until 17.55pm and we were promptly transferred to the terminal by an awaiting bus and were in the terminal at 18.00. I advised my wife and children to go and retrieve the bags and I raced up to the Easy Jet counter to commence check in. By the time I got to the counter it was 18.18pm on my watch and on the clocks in the terminal but there were no Easy Jet staff at the check in at all. The next day there was an Air Traffic Controllers strike that had been scheduled and we had non-refundable accommodation and other paid activities in London. I went looking for the Easy Jet representative in the Terminal who advised that as it was at that stage, 18.21pm by her watch the flight had closed, there were no staff available and there was nothing she could do other than advise us that due to industrial action and bookings we would not be likely to get paid seats with Easy Jet for 3 days. Faced with this I looked for flights departing to London that night and found a British Airways flight due to depart at 19.10. I was advised by a BA representative that she may be able to get 5 seats but would not know until 18.40. She managed to get 5 economy seats for which I was charged in excess of EURO2500 or Australian $3557.00. I spoke to BA the next day in London and a staff member told me that I was charged adult fares for the two children under 12 and that I should be entitled to a 25% refund. The battle to do this is still going on with the BA refunds section and the initial response that I received when the matter was referred to BA customer relations was that BA only have 2 classes of economy seats adult and infant ie 2 and under. There website would suggest otherwise. I have written to Easy Jet and am awaiting a response and will detail it in this forum when it is to hand. I think the moral of this story is that allow the widest possible berth between connection if travelling on a discount carrier. Do not accept the check in closure time will be adhered to by staff of a budget carrier and make sure that you have travel insurance that covers the scenario of a missed connection, as many policies in this regard will only give you a limited amount in very limited circumstances. I will keep you all posted. ------- Sydney\n",

Until last week I hadn't flown from CWL since the incident in the previous thread, but last Monday once again my contact lens solution was selected at for testing ... Once again, the staff were polite and professional - but this time I was prepared! My regular \"explosive\" solution was in my checked luggage, and in my hand luggage I was just carrying a 100ml bottle of solution that Specsavers said shouldn't test positive - and they were right. It passed the swab test and I was allowed to take it with me. In all the years I've been travelling I have never had contact lens solution tested at any other airport (apart from once in Bilbao, when they suspected it was something totally different - but that's another story ...), but maybe this will help anyone travelling through Cardiff with contact lens solution in their hand luggage - they seem to be on the lookout for it (I was assured I was simply chosen at random, though I'm sure I spotted a look of glee in the security staff eyes when they saw the bottle going through the X-ray machine ...). For clarification, the solution that tested positive was Specsavers' Easyvision Allpurpose solution; the \"safe\" solution is the Easyvision Multipurpose. If anyone needs a 100ml bottle, they have a stock in Specsavers in Queen Street Cardiff ;-)\n",

(a guy speaking sllllooowly and telling you everything is going to be fiiiinnne.) I listened to it on my last flight the whole way, and the 2 weeks leading up to it. By no means do I love flying now, but I can tolerate it, and I'm not anxious and fearful. I encourage anyone with the same feelings that I did to check it out!\n",

We're flying British Airways from LHR to Singapore, but our connecting flight is on Jetstar, and as we have quite a long time between flights in Changi (12 hours), we would like to make use of the transit hotel. However, as we will not be checked in from London straight through to Bali, we will have to reclaim our bags from the BA flight and then check in to the Jetstar one. As far as I can tell, both airlines use Terminal 1. My question is: will we be classed as transit passengers and therefore be able to use the transit hotel? My concern is that we will have to clear immigration in order to collect our bags, but then find that we are stuck landside and unable to use the hotel because check-in for our Jetstar flight to Bali doesn't open until several hours after our flight from London arrives. If anyone could put my mind at rest I'd be most grateful - thank you!\n",

      "We are flying to Orlando in 2 weeks for our last full family holiday as our eldest is oing to NZ in October to live. As it was special we paid extra to go with Thomson, as it was adverised as a Dreamliner route and then decided to go Premium to make it more special. We got an email today from Thomson telling us that they have changed the plane back to one that doesn't have any premium seats, I presume this is the 767. I imagine this has happened before so has anyone had any experience with Thomson on getting a decent explanation why? We have been refunded the money for the one way but it's more to do with spooling my daughters dream holiday. My youngest is 8, is a big aircraft fanatic and is really upset and is now experiencing a negative before we have even set off. It may sound petty but we only booked with Thomson because of the Dreamliner and Virgin was cheaper.\n",

The service I have received by them in the last 24h has been absolutely appalling. After a cancelled flight I was made to wait for almost 4 hours to be attended, at which time any options for rebooking has already left or were full. Hence my morning meeting on 23/11 will be missed, and my prepaid car rental at MIA is lost. I reschedule meetings for 4pm on 23/11 assuming a 12:25 landing. After waking up at 5am I arrive at the airport to find that my 8:30am flight had become a 10:20am flight (no email or courtesy call from AF). So another meeting to reschedule last minute and perhaps lost business. Additionally the upgrade to premium economy I was promised.....no longer the case today! This is the absolute worst treatment by an airline I have ever received and I intent to pursue my rights as a passenger according to EC261/2004 or other applicable regulations to ensure my losses and expenses are reimbursed.

With the rising cost of fuel the airline has found ways of reducing the fuel bill by reducing the weight it carries on its flights. They will be shrinking the size of its in-flight magazines from A4 to A5 size, carrying less ice on flights and believe it or not, \"encouraging\" staff to watch their weight - with the motivation of appearing in the annual Ryanair calendar! But Ryanair are only following in the foot steps of other airlines ... In the 1980's, American Airlines claimed that they saved $40,000 by taking out one olive from every salad in first class and more recently, Japanese airline All Nippon Airways started asking passengers to go to the toilet before boarding in a bid to reduce carbon emissions!

      "Our son lives in Atlanta and from time to time we get our grandchildren to come visit us in Florida. They have been flying in and out of Orlando on Air Tran. Now this is NOT a rant post against Air Tran but I am going to start flying them on Delta out of Melbourne. Reason being that the last two times we went to Orlando the service was so slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow that they missed the booked flight. Their luggage made it A ok but it took so long to get me a gate pass after they were checked in that we did not get to the gate in time. The problem seems to be two fold. First of all there are NOT enough agents to handle the load. Second is that you must stand in a line that is at the very end of the ticketing area and do not have a dedicated agent to deal with. So you must wait until another line is empty or another agent comes from the \"back\" to assist you. Maybe it is just Orlando and not Air Tran but I have never had any of those problems flying from Melbourne. Additionaly the security at Orlando is poorly organized and the TSA agents are in no hurry to get you to the airside on time. That is NOT the case in Melbourne as they are expediant and professional at all times.\n",

      "I appreciate that there are still alot of stranded people out there and I hope you all get home soon. but here was our story. I thought it best to wait 'till we all got home so we can give hopefully a balanced perspective of events. We were due to fly home on 15th April, when it all first happened from Atlanta. We were about 250 miles from the airport, just waking up in our hotel room when we heard the news on CNN, and obviously devastated. It was more the \"not knowing\" than anything else. The website (BA) told us not to go to the airport, and it was about 2.5 hours to speak to someone on the phone. We had to go and return the rental car anyway at ATL so had some hours to calm down and think a bit, rather than turn up to check in totally unaware and panic. The news in the U.S on this was fairly low key at the time from what we saw, and we got more information by logging on to UK news websites, it really felt like doom and gloom from what the media were saying. On our arrival at check in, we handed in my pre printed boarding passes to the BA check in staff, and decided just to book ourselves on the next available flight out, which was 6 days later. Again feeling devastated by the wait and potential additional expense that wasn't budgeted for (or so we thought). The kids were upset, the wife too, however \"keep calm\" I said to myself, trying to hold it all together ,as there is nothing you can do. BA check in staff were truely exceptional, along with ATL dispatchers for the flight (BA226 ATL-LHR on 15th Apr '10). Although they could not doing anything about the flight, their service went beyond the call of duty in terms of help, advice, and being put up in a hotel nearby with all meals paid for. BA, the hotel staff, ATL staff, and the British Consulate in downtown all worked together for the benefit of the passengers. All of them worked 110% to help us, and it will never be forgotten. I was aware of the other horror stories from other airlines just \"dumping\" their passengers with little more than $7 per day to survive on. We remember a group of 4/5 parent helpers looking after 20 or so kids who were representing the UK in a robotic tournament in Atlanta flying on an American airline who had to start paying out of their own pockets. I hope you got back safely if you're reading this. We also rememberd at the consulate, another passenger \"dumped\" by another European airline, with no one to talk to, speak to, or given any advice until the Consulate stepped in. There are hundreds more I know, and we are lucky to be what I think are the fortunate few who flew on BA. I'm not one to hype up BA, as I had some reservations on flying with them, but after this experience, and if I ever decide to fly again then there will only be 1 airline to choose from. I hope everyone can receive some form of recompense. Up to then my faith in British society had been strained to say the least, but this experience is something I'll never forget, that yes there are people out there who care and want to make a difference. I hope everyone out there still gets home safely and quickly.\n",

      "Hi, As information for any US passport holder or future applicant. New passport fees will become effective from 13 July 2010 onward. This is for all applications lodged *on or after* this date. Remember if you use a passport acceptance office (like a US post office) or one of the regional Department of State Passport Offices, it's the date on which you actually file or submit your application that will determine the fee matrix. If you are eligible to, and use regular US Mail for submission, it's the post mark date that will govern. Note that the one of the biggest increases (expressed as percentage) is in the additional page insert fee, which goes from *free* to $82 per insert added. Here's the entire new fee matrix from the DoS' Passport Services page: travel.state.gov/passport/fees/fees_5079.html If your passport is going to expire soon, will have less than 6 months validity, or you need to add extra pages, this would be an *excellent* time to do so, before the new fee matrix becomes applicable.

      "Yesterday I flew home from Jeddah via Doha on Qater Airways. On boarding the flight from Doha to Manchester it was quite chaotic in the forward economy cabin of the Airbus A330. Numerous families had unilaterally decided to seat themselves together regardless of their seat assignments. The poor FA spent 15 mins trying to get people into their correct seats. I reserved my usual aisle seat, but I had now been moved into a central aisle seat rather than my usual window aisle seat. I would hazard a guess this occurred to try and keep a family on the same row if possible, no big deal to be honest. However in my row was a mother and 2 children. The father of the family demanded rather than ask that I change seats with him, now if he'd been seated in business then fair enough, even accounting for his rather rude attitude. However he was seated in a centre seat behind me, I told him sorry but I dislike to being trapped in. He then became extremely rude, at which point I reported him to the FA. The FA had a word with him and he went off in Huff to his seat. Several hours later his young son looked at me and said \" your the nasty bl@@dy man who wouldn't move\" I guess that comment says it all really, clearly such language shouldn't come from a 3 yr old child. I have moved before to try and assist a family, as long as it's a similar seat close by then that's fine. This rather rude incident will definitely give me pause for thought in future. I think it was the overriding rude sense of entitlement that annoyed me. Regards Rick\n",

      "The reason of this email is to explain an unfortunate situation, me and other 10 passengers suffered at the Denpasar Airport on the 19 of December 2015. We arrived at the Denpasar airport, 19 of December 2015 with the flight VA65 from Sydney. Virgin. Now, we went to the transit Area in Denpasar and ask for Qatar Airways assistance. Nobody was there to do the checkin for transit passengers. We requested assitance to the airport personnel, but they did not help at all and told us that I we did not want to loose the connection flight, we had to do custom clearance, get our luggage and do the check in again at the Qatar desk. The personnel of the airport was disrespectful and with a total lack of customer service attitude. We had little time to decide and we finally made to the check in counter of qatar at the airport. When we did the check in, we were charged 200.000 rp which I think is completely wrong. 1) The airport tax was included in my ticket as the regulation changed on February 2015, Denpasar Airport tax was included , as I booked my flight during Sept 2015. 2) We were passenger in transit that did not get any help from Qatar or airport personnel and we wanted to take our flight. Passengers in transit should not pay the 200.000 rp. So, for the above stated, and because it was Qatar airways the carrier collecting the money, I am requesting the refund of it as I paid it twice. Another point to have in mind, right now I am at the Denpasar airport again, as a transit passenger, I arrived from Doha with Qatar airways and I am connecting to Sydey with Virgin. Virgin personnel was waiting for us on the transit counter of the airport of Denpasar, we did the check in and we did not pay for anything. So Virgin did his part on this situation, and Qatar did not.\n",

No staff members were informing the travellers about any delays. 2) Food was extremely poor especially for the cost of $25 per person per flight. Going to Hawaii we only had one choice for each meal: Dinner : Small size Chicken and Rice, Salad and a small chocolate . Breakfast: A meat pie (Yes, that is right) for breakfast and a ice cream bar. Not my idea of a breakfast meal at 3am. 3) The flight crew were nearly invisible, mostly talking to each other for the flight, as our rubbish stayed infront of us for atleast 1-1.5 hours. 4) In flight entertainment - was not handed out until at least 2 hour into the flight.\n",

I've avoided this airline for so long, because everybody I know told me to basically avoid Aeroflot unless absolutely necessary. I'm looking for a decent ticket for my fly between North Europe and Tokyo. The cheaper the better when it comes to price, but flight duration is more important to me. I just looked up and the fastest is with either Aeroflot or Finnair for this route. But there is a huge price difference (Aeroflot is offering one-way tickets for 1/3 of Finnair's price). My dilemma is that other routs are much longer than these. I don't want to have a layover in Continental Europe because that becomes a detour. But Finnair's prices are more expensive than other airlines that offer flights from Europe to Tokyo. I'm debating if it's safe to fly with Aeroflot... I've seen comments that say it's not that bad any more. But then again, I hear horrific stories. If you've flown with Aeroflot recently, I'd love to hear your story, especially between Moscow-Tokyo.

      "Think twice if you are travelling to the Maldives with Thomson. We were delayed 22hours last week and were late arriving at Male. We are both airline crew so were wise to the excuses they gave. They basically blamed snow, Spanish ATC and fog at Gatwick, all of which were lies! The airline were most unhelpful and had no reps at any point during the delay and lied to us about the reason for the heavy delay. Thomson couldn't even send a rep the next day to the Gatwick Hilton hotel with details of our departure time and on our return we should have been given a letter stating a technical problem for the delay not all the lies originally given. Despite asking for an address to write to for compensation via the rep in the Maldives she failed to give us a letter on why the delay happened, which we were entitled to and had to get a copy of this via a kind passenger. Because of the dishonesty and the fact they were spineless to confront their passengers we won't be using them again.

Frontier is the only airline to fly nonstop from Columbus to Milwaukee, plus the only airline to fly out of Rhinelander. The first time I checked the fare was $175. Due to circumstances beyond my control, could not book it then. Last Thursday, ready to book, fare was $458! After I recovered from my heart attack, I explored other options and booked the lowest fare I could find, Delta thru Memphis, then Frontier to Rhinelander.

Thomsons declined stating it was extra ordinary circumstances. Basically the flight from Majorca was delayed because the flight into majorca was delayed due to ongoing planned roundworks near to the airport causing \"some staff and passengers to be late for the outgoing flight\". These roadworks had been ongoing for more than 2 weeks prior to the date and therefore all staff/passengers should have been aware of the possibilities of delays and allowed extra time. The flight was also n a Sunday evening so this should have not been as much of a problem as it would have been at peak traffic times. After they declined my daughter wrote to the Spanish aviation authority and they agreed and advised compensation should be paid to the amount of é400 per passenger. Thomsons still refused and have refused to answer any further communication. She did all the communication via the online form - should we send in one last letter by post or should we proceed to the small claims court and in our opinions do you think she has a good chance of succeeding with the compensation claim.\n",

No flights available this day, nor the next day - that would get us to CPH in time for the evening sailing of our cruise ship. We agreed to an 10AM standby for CPH, and a alternative code share routing that would get us close to the port where the ship would be on the second sailing day. We spent the night wandering Heathrow Airport, and retrieved our checked luggage. Not much sleep. Next morning - no luck at Standby. Rushed to the alternate plan - and flew up to Manchester UK. Then - rushed to another terminal to partner Lufthanza for a flight to Munich Germany.

We ordered train tickets over the phone for a specified time (12:45pm) and got on the trian only to find out that we were given the wrong boarding passes (2:45pm). We noticed this after a request to show our tickets half-way enroute to London. The conductor on that train was so rude and didn't listen to any of our complaints and ended up slapping us in the face with a fine of 101 British pounds ($190) each with my travel compainion. Our efforts to discuss the matter with Virgin trains were turned away. On the same car another lady had the same problem but was welcomed with police at the train station in Euston because she failed to pay the fine. We had tickets and it wasn't our fault that we had boarded the train at the wriong time- in my opinion! To be fined extra fees yet the train had extra empty seats left a lot to be desired.

      "I have recently switched to Clear Care, a hydrogen peroxide based contact lens solution, due to my eye care professional's recommendation. In a few months, this will be my first time traveling with it (by air). I have been hearing stories of TSA officers confiscating such solution in carry on baggage and not being able to negotiate citing medical necessity as a reason, even when the bottle is in compliance with the 3-1-1 limitation. The reasoning is that hydrogen peroxide can potentially be used as an explosive. I am wondering what people's experiences are with this? I have always known that it is best to have enough of your contact lens care material in your carry on baggage in case your checked baggage gets delayed. However, I now use exclusively Clear Care, and if that does not make it through TSA, I will be left with nothing upon arrival if my checked baggage gets delayed. I am planning to travel to an Asian destination, where there is almost no guarantee that I will be able to find the product for sale.

They are always packed with too few staff (counters & \"TSA\" checkpoints), the flights NEVER take off on time, you can't understand the PA system and a Coke costs 6 Euros. And, I have a problem every time I use Alitalia. They are famous for switching your seats if they have an Alitalia frequent flyer book after you who asks for your seats. They always give first priority to their own frequent flyers. It's happened to me three times now (most recently 9/14), so they still do it. You can go ahead book through Delta, but make sure that it's a Delta flight on Delta equipment. Otherwise, you're taking your chances.

      "First of all - let me say - I know baggage allowances exist for good reason - and that we should abide by them - This post is not about that - its about how in certain situations staff really make it hard for customers to like a brand. I was flying Ork-Birmigham on an ATR72 (double prop plane with limited overhead baggage space). I fly this route relatively often - and as often as not hand luggage is take from you and put in the hold. Also - as often as not this plane runs at least 30 minutes late. So I arrive in Cork and would prefer not to have to have bags checked - but they are as its a pretty full flight. C'est la Vie. The flight leaves late due to late inbound craft -(which is a BS excuse really - - a more honest one would be the craft was late because its on an end to end schedule with very tight turnaround times, and we stuffed up somewhere earlier in the day) So I land an hour late and then have to wait for my bags - C'est la vie. On my return leg - I decide to ask at check in should I check my bag - I get advised that if I do there will be a charge (at least 50% of the time that i fly this route I am forced to check it - which of course is free - but I prefer not having to check it). I inform the staff member (Ms Ragdish) that i have no desire to check it, but will it be taken off me. She asks me to present it for weighing - and as it weighs 11KG she says I must pay 40£ to check it. I offered to take something out but she stated that then my laptop case would be over weight. So I had to pay 40£ to have a suitcase taken off me that would have been taken off me anyway. I only offered as having flown the route many times I wanted to assist on making things run smoother. And this was how I was repayed What a lousy customer loyalty reward. Then the PLane ran 75 minutes late. Michael O'Leary from Ryan Air decided a year and a half ago that it wasnt a good idea to muck about as much on luggage restrictions - and moved away from it in favour of better customer services. Aer lingus have apparently decided to try and see if they can make that failed policy work. Can I ask the question of Aer Lingus - If you try to emulate his failed baggage policy, could I implore you to try and at least aim for his successful on time policy? (soap box dismantled)\n",

      "This is not an airline I thought I would ever use. However, I booked a short break and only at the end of the booking did the lady mention it was a Ryanair flight. (Thanks to those of you on this forum that pointed out Ryanair don’t actually permit this; thankfully we were fine). I spent forever obsessing about my hand luggage and in the end opted to take only a rucksack – was only staying 3 nights. As soon as I arrived at the airport I headed straight to their bag measurers to ensure it was the right size. Turns out it could have been double the size and it would still have been okay. However, I needn’t have bothered because no one checked the size or weight of the bag before boarding either of the flights. In fact, as far as I could see no one on either of our flights had their bags checked. I did wonder though if this was because of flight was running late because as we were queuing to board we could see people departing the plane. Funnily enough we taxied right on time and for the return flight we left about 10 minutes late. I spent ages entering the online check in details as there’s a charge for entering information incorrectly. Again, I needn’t have bothered as the guy barely glanced my passport as he tore my boarding pass. When we did get onboard there did seem to be a problem with some people’s luggage as there wasn’t room overhead for everything but they managed to squeeze cases under some people’s seat. The plane seemed clean as far as I could see and the seats were comfy. Only criticism was that the seats did not recline nor were there any pockets on the back of the seat in front of you to store newspapers etc. I didn’t purchase any drinks or snacks as I took my own on board. And the little interaction I had with staff was pleasant enough. Another slightly annoying things was that my mum, who travels on a Barbados passport, had to have her boarding pass stamped before departure or she’s refused boarding. They make this very clear for the departure flight but I didn’t think it was necessary for the return flight. Praise God I decided to check to be on the safe side because it turns out it needs to be stamped in both directions. So, the nightmares I had in the lead up to the flight were unfounded. However, there was a couple at our hotel who flew out on another Ryanair flight and were charged the £40 for being a kilo over weight. To me it begged the question of whether there was something they could have thrown away and purchased once they landed but hey. Would I fly Ryanair again? Probably not of my choosing but if I absolutely had to then I guess I would as long as I was careful to follow all their rules.\n",

I was very apprehensive and expecting some delays, but everything was fine. We flew out of the Hamilton, Ontario, terminal and it was great! So compact, no walking, just park the car, walk in, check in, and on the plane. Wonderful compared to Pearson. Arrived in Dublin, Ireland on time. Flight over was in an older aircraft purchased from an Icelandic airline. We bought economy no frills and it was pretty tight for leg room. If you have long legs, spring for the premier. Other than that, it was just fine - plane left and arrived on time. On the flight home, we got a \"free\" meal and non alcoholic drinks, even though it said on the website you needed to preorder the meals. The people that preordered got a different meal (beef or pasta dish). We got a type of chili with vegetables and a bun with a dessert. Can't say every flight will go as smoothly, but I hope this will help with some of the apprehension involved with this airline.\n",

      "Feb 2nd, 2008 I was at Newark/Liberty airport to pick up a puppy that was being sent to me from a breeder in Texas. Unfortunately this breeder used American Airlines to transport the dog. I had used the useless flight tracker to get updated on the status of flight 558 and tracked the \"Airway Bill/Confirmation number\" to track as well. I called American Airlines Cargo prior to going to the airport. The flight was scheduled to arrive early and I took my family to the airport to pick up our new dog. After waiting for well over two hours after the flight landed, the people representing American Airlines Cargo could not give any information other than \"we don't know where the dog is, there were no dogs on flight 558\". They offered NO direction or help other than asking people to leave the carge office. In fact all four people behind the counter disappeared into a side \"break room\" with a poor attitude and suggessted we call in a few hours to see if the \"packages\" were found. Disgraceful. There were 11 families waiting and as this dragged on with absolutely no communication there was obviously frustration. The solution for the American Airlines employees was to call the airport security. These were families with children waiting and this was an absurd way to handle the situation. I called the breeder who could not get any information. I called American Airlines twice from my cell phone, only to be told that the dog in fact was at Newark airport as the flight had landed with the dog was on it. Not true but this was the only information available. Clearly no one knew what was going on and there is a serious flaw in their tracking capabilities. The fact that an error was made was not the issue. The complete inability of anyone representing AA at the airport or on the phone to address the situation was beyond irresponsible. The people in the cargo office were rude, unprofessional and dismissive. In fact, as we waited there were people from other flights coming to claim pets that were also lost because American Airlines never bothered to put them on the flight. AA systems are dangerously flawed. The employees are incompetenent, don't care and the airline is incapable of being trusted to transport an animal, child or anything of value. These puppies and family pets were left unattended in small crates for an unhealthy amount of time, neglected by American Airlines. They truly think of animals as nothing more than cargo and have zero concern for the health and well being of any animal they are transporting. If they can not responsibly transport a dog, YOU are not safe on this Airline. They have obviously stopped caring at all and should do us all a favor by declaring bancruptcy and get out of a business that has clearly passed them by.\n",

United is interested in filling and moving planes, not in serving customers. In my opinion, United's skies definitely are not friendly. The folks at the desk lied to me (told me that seat 29B was economy plus) and were rude. The flight attendant at the back was insolent. And one of the United staff actually threatened me. There MUST be a better way to travel.\n",

The flight was 2 hours late to begin with, but the Zoom representative placated me when I expressed concern that I would miss my connection, telling me that Ryanair only charged GBP 20 to rebook. I arrived at Gatwick 5 hours late, Ryanair told me I was out of luck and had to buy a new ticket for an additional GBP 200 (about $400.00 and 20 times what I paid for the original Ryanair ticket). Zoom accepted zero responsibility for their late arrival although it wasn't due to weather or any other systemic delay.

      "Easyjet posted on their website that they were going to honour the baggage allowance that GB customers would have had (1 case up to 23 kilos) this was posted weeks ago and is still on there. They have now added another entry saying that GB customers will get 1 case up to 20 kilos and both of these conflicting items are still on their website. I phoned last Friday and they confirmed the 23 kilos was right, I phoned yesterday and they said it was 20 kilos and the lady had to look on line to find out what I ment, then she came back to me and said that the 23kilos was a mistake and they would only allow up to 20 kilos. When the sale went through and the e mail was sent out they say one thing and as soon as you confirm they move the goal post. I told them that it obviously not a mistake but a deliberate change of their mind. As our flight going out is still with GB and now coming back with Easyjet with 2 different allowances which is really annoying, as they also informed me that one case cannot be 22 kilos and another 18 which is even more annoying. I have printed off the website answer to the question which says that GB passengers will not have their baggage allowance changed, do you think I have a leg to stand on if I take this to the airport.

      "The topic of airfare price drops has been done to death I guess but I'll give it another whack. Is Air Canada the worst offender? I am not an experienced air traveller but I was very surprised to find the airfare for the same flights I booked in early February from Australia to Vancouver return (Sep/Oct travel) have dropped by 25% six weeks later! I booked the cheapest fare (economy tango) for my family on our first international trip and I chose Air Canada because it is a direct flight and we have limited time during school holidays. The airlines seem to know when it is holiday time and bump up the prices. I have to say 25% is a significant price drop for the same class seats on the same flights. I am disappointed at losing $2000 and it is an unfortunate lesson. If I could afford the higher fares I gather the tickets would be refundable and I would not lose out, except for the nasty cancellation fee. My tickets are not refundable and I am informed there is no option to rebook at the new lower fare. I wouldn't mind so much if the price drop wasn't so large. If this is a normal occurrence it seems booking with Air Canada is like spending money on a lottery ticket.\n",

      "My family and I booked 4 tickets to New York for a week long stay, a week cruise, and then reurn home. Given that the day the ship returns to port, we will also have to fly back home, I called British Airways and asked in the slim possibility that Internet will not be avaialble on board the ship (distance, technical problems etc) what can be done if anything to ensure that all 4 family members can be together for the long flight back home. It is a very remote possibility that Internet will not be available on board the ship, but who knows.... I just wanted to make sure that we do not have any unplesant surprises. To my dismay they said that airport check-in is possible but do not guarantee that we will all be seated together. They asked for a total of 200EUR to preallocate the seats. I would expect this from a low-cost budget airline but certainly not from BA. I did not ask for a ticket change or any other upgrade or service (like extra luggage or preferential seating) I should pay for, but paying 5000EUR for 4 tickets and then being asked for another 200EUR for the simplest of service, it really bothers me. In my opinion this is a \"nickel and dime\" practice at best. I wrote them an email about it, and they did NOT even respond to it. I would at least expect a typical answer from them. Are my expectations unreasonable (do not overcharge for services, replay to complaint emails)???? Thank you all, Andreas\n",

I'll try to keep this brief. Phx-PHL leg uneventful. Got to PHL and checked in at gate and big problem. They had to downsize the aircraft from a 767 to a 757 and were asking volunteers to give up seats. I had a HUGE event plannd in London next night I could not give my seat up. Finally they had enough volunteers and they tried to split me and my freind up. I said no way she is elderly and can barely walk and needs assistance with everything so they put us back together. Got to LHR safely. Had great trip. Flight back..huge overbook and again asking for volunteers, at least no aircraft downgrade. Left almost on time, not 1 seat to spare. Got to PHL and sat on runway for almost an hour no open gates. I had to reclaim my bag, go through security again, ran with my carryon and laptop to the gate and missed the jet by 5 minutes. I had to stay the night without any of my bags they had already been checked. No clean clothes, nothing. All toiletries sitting in Phx. Got small care package from airline with toothbrush, shampoo thats it. Cell phone dead because charger in suitcase.

Flying from San Diego (commuter plane) to LAX where we fly British Air to Heathrow and then into Stockholm. Hope to pack in just carry on, not because we don't want to pay for luggage, but because on our last trip, through Heathrow, British Air lost our checked bag(s) in BOTH directions. The carry on suitcase, that I have used successfully in the past, is the 22\" from Costco with 2 wheels only. I did carry it on a year and a half ago on British Air without any problem. Also, it did fit into the sizing frame on an American Air domestic flight this past May, when the LAX porter said \"that bag is too big for a carry on!\" but I am concerned about whether British Air has a new size restriction for carry on bags. The bag measures 23\" from wheels to top, even though it is sold as a 22\". If we are going to have to check this bag after arrival at the airport, I might as well pack in a large bag and not have to worry about what I pack. What are your thoughts?\n",

When they asked us for our passenger information we provided them with the correct information regarding first and last names. However, when they sent our itinerary, my first name was misspelled. I usually write my name as 'Luuk', while my passport says 'Lucas'. I remember signing emails with Luuk, yet I also know that I gave the correct passport names when asked. When I was at Heathrow airport I first encountered that the name on my ticket didnt match my passport. At that point it wasn't to big a deal, but I got to fly anyway. I tried to change my name at the AIR New Zealand service desk, but they couldnt do it and said that the travel agent had to do it. I'm currently in Australia after stopping over in Hong Kong. I could make all flights with the wrong name, even if that sometimes led to skewed faces. I've contacted the travel agent (Travel Nation) and asked them if they could change my name, since I provided them with the correct names. They told me it couldnt be done, since I already started travelling. Instead the added a note, stating that my first name was misspelled. In the accompanying email (in which my first name was misspelled again as Luuc!!!!!) they stated that 'this is not a guarantee for the USA'. So now I'm getting a bit freaked. I'm sure that I will be able to fly to all my other destinations, but If I cant fly to the US, that would be awfull. Is there nothing that can be done?\n",

I have read reviews where members seem to have a pompous attitude to dress code and snub any form of casual sports wear. My son looks very respectable in his fashion wear and is clean and tidy. I have worked in office environments where business men dressed in suits are offensive due to their uncleanliness but because it is a suit and looks business it is deemed. Dress code is surely subjective for an airport lounge where people are meant to be in holiday mode! Shouldn't the fact that a person is be clean and tidy and respectful be more important than what line of attire they are wearing? I totally agree that a person should dress respectful in terms of not revealing too much flesh but reasonable length shorts and trainers...what is the problem? Maybe there should be a business lounge purely for business attire and an exclusive lounge for respectful people who can wear any fashion provided they are clean, tidy and respectful to others.\n",

However, looking through various sites even US based clients have had several issues regarding this company not providing compensation for legitimate complaints. I have sent the following email to the founder of Apple Leisure and the CEO and they refuse to respond. You will also notice the contact info for this company is very vague on their website. In short, we have booked vacations through many on-line companies that are ethical. THis one is not so do not expect any client support from them..... I am writing today to tell you how disappointed I am in your misleading business practices and disgusted I am with your customer support (a common thread in many reviews for your company). I shop on-line a lot and book trips through on-line travel sites so I am knowledgeable on how things work at check-out. I am from Canada and shop in the US, UK and, of course, Canada. We used Cheap Caribbean last year to book a trip and we were charged Canadian funds (funds were at par) and because of this we assumed your company charges us in our currency. There is NOTHING on the website or at checkout to indicate otherwise. For example, even when we book with Hotwire US we are quoted at checkout USD meaning the final price states clearly USD. Cheap Caribbean does not specify anywhere on the website or on our ticket voucher you charge in USD. There is nothing in your contract either to indicate you charge in USD. We were pretty shocked when we were billed $450+ more than we were invoiced for on our credit card. When I called customer care indicating I expect a refund the differance I was informed by a robotic like human ...we are a US company we charge in USD. I could not get Bobby to understand the issue is not that you charge in USD, you don't tell your customers you charge USD. A call to the supervisor was a waste of time. He could care less. The LAST think a customer wants to here is \"we are not doing anything for you\". So, as a result of this I have filed a complaint with the BBB and had several conversations with my friends and coworkers telling them how misleading this company is and all I spoke to are shocked you do not indicate what currency you charge in. Your refusal to pay back what you should not have charged in the first place will cost you a lot of future business. Your lack of action speaks volumes about your business practices (shady) and you lack of interest in customer satisfaction. Also, you may want to have a supervisor train your service reps. When asked ``How are you`the response of `I am okay`is not professional at all. In addition, perhaps educate your staff that a .com company does not indicate you are US based. I work for a Canadian based company with a .com site. Then again, we are ethical and clearly indicate currency charged on our invoices.\n",

Passengers may only carry small quantities (max. 100 ml per container) of liquids, gels and aerosols in their hand baggage. The packaging of these products must also meet specific requirements. This applies for all passengers departing from or catching connecting flights at airports within the European Union. The new rules apply for liquids such as water and other drinks, but also extend to gels, pastes, lotions, and the contents of aerosols. This includes toiletries such as toothpaste, shaving cream, hair gel, lip gloss, facial creams, mascara and liquid lip balms.

Free drinks and good food with extremely pleasant staff. I can't fault this airline for value for money!! I understand they are having a new lounge and check in at Newark in the near future. We had to spend 7 hours there on our way back and as there is no left baggage facility at the airport and the Silverjet lounge didn't open until midday we couldn't get in to NY for the day which was our intention. However, that is hardly Silverjet's fault and as I understand they are shortly starting another flight to NY presumably the check in will be open for more hours. Anyway the lounge was perfectly comfortable, with plenty of food and drinks should one need it. All in all a great experience and we shall certainly never travel to NY any other way.\n",

I was told overbooking by 10% was “legal” due to it being the \"high travel season.\" This seems to be common practice by Aeromexico, whatever the whatever the season, as I and others have experienced this on numerous occasions with this airline (a friend booked on the next flight had the same experience), convincing me to avoid Aeromexico at all costs. After speaking with an extremely unhelpful and rude supervisor, and explaining our situation, she said she would investigate further and disappeared, only to return 45 minutes later to again repeat there were no seats for us. She promised to place us first on a wait list for the flight we had booked.

      "Beware what you get with budget airlines ... you probably will get what you pay for --- or in my case less. Flew Spirit Airlines from New York to Myrtle Beach and back last week with my wife and two-year old. Of course with kids (especially with safety seats that have to be in window seat to prevent blocking the egress path) I knew we'd be ponying up a significant chunk of change for baggage charges and pre-paid seat assignments. Flights were delayed, lines were long, ground staff was overworked and, with exception of one nice man, rude ... but figured you get what you pay for. Little did I know, you can actually get less than you paid for --- on the return flight the Spirit Airlines computer system was down in Myrtle Beach --- causing in addition to very long lines (always fun with a 2-year old), the loss of all information on who pre-paid for seats and baggage so it would be open seating. Annoying, but we were informed that all baggage would be free and anyone pre-paying for baggage or seat assignments would get a refund by calling the 1-800 number. Other than asking twice for the 1-800 number and never getting it, we did arrive safely in NY two hours late which is not horrible for LaGuardia. However, upon returning and calling the 1-800 number I was informed that since I did check luggage and did use 3 seats - I would not have any money refunded. So you can get less that what you paid for --- even on a budget airline.\n",

Obviously you don't expect or get full service on a short island hop, but it's quite adequate. There may be something in the WI culture (or LIAT training) which doesn't generate an instant but synthetic 'have a nice day' welcome but, if you engage with the staff, my experience was that you receive a warm & informed response.

      "Hi, I am flying in November from Orlando to Las Vegas with American Airlines. Looking over my flights, I'm not really feeling confident and just wanted to check if I should go ahead with this flight, or if I should be contacting American to see about a change? We fly from Orlando to Charlotte, have a 48 minute connection From from Charlotte to Phoenix, have around 90 minutes before we board our last flight to Vegas. That first connection time is very short. I am just a bit concerned that myself or my luggage might not make it. Just was after an opinion of what people think I should do, or if it would be fine? :) (also all the flights are on the same ticket, purchased at the same time) Thanks Edited: 3:51 am, August 04, 2016\n",

      "Fore warned is fore armed - on a recent vacation to Jamaica my girlfriend became seriously ill and had to be put into a hospital (very frightening as you can imagine) However, when she was released to fly the next day I called Air Jamaica and was told the change fee would be $150 each. While high I know most airlines charge for this so I said OK. It was then that the reservations clerk said - Oh this is a non-stop flight so it will be $280 to re-book. AS we had just come through a very trying experience I was in no position to change planes in Kingston. I wrote to Air Jamaica and they have never written back. Further there is no way to get in touch with a human reservations clerk in the US. Not a very good situation. I also went on a few travel review sites seems that I am one of many people who have had a bad experience with this airline.

I originally bought the round trip tickets: \"Toronto->China\" and \"China->Toronto\". In between I'm also planning on going to other nearby countries(Hongkong, Taiwan, Japan). I haven't bought other tickets yet, including the last flight from \"Japan->China\" (the one I'm trying to avoid buying right now) The reason that I bought the roundtrip instead of one way was because originally I was planning on going back to China again after my trips for couple weeks then return to Toronto. But right now something came up and I will have to return early... Basically, I'm asking if there's a way to change my return roundtrip flight from \"china->toronto\" to \"japan->toronto\"? so I won't have to buy another ticket from japan to china just to get on the return flight. :( Please let me know what would be the best option for me.

      "Flying to Orlando from Manchester I booked 2 exit seats to get the extra leg room - row 49, seats J+K. 49 H+J had acres of leg room, but 49K had virtually no leg room! The reason is that the exit door has a huge box in front of it, presumably to store the slide to be used in an emergency. Since this is right in front of seat 49K, there is almost no leg room - it is worse than the normal seats! I complained to the steward, who said that there was nothing he could do but to log it as an incident. Fortunately for us, there was no-one sitting in seat 49H so we used H+J and had a great flight - but it could have been much worse.

      "Flew yesterday from Manchester to Orlando. Routing was originally via Atlanta with 4 hour layover prior to onward to MCO. 10 pax with reserved seating in economy. All pretty routine. Half of party arrives at MAN and calls me as checking out hotel, Atlanta flight overbooked. Heart sinks as travelling first time where it is just me with three sons, and sons girlfriend. So as I am mentally thinking EU261 rules, this is quickly followed up by they want to know if we are willing to switch to non stop flight leaving 30 minutes later. Heck yes, especially with a PE upgrade thrown in. 747-400 (Barbarella): great IFE, pretty good food (chicken well spicy must have read the tomato juice experiment), excellent attentive service. Seat are good pitch, but for me are not the most comfortable with headrest adjustment poor. Economy on way home is going too be a let down for the kids, hey ho. MCO arrival was excellent. We were an hour from wheels down to driving out the rental car garage. Immigration was empty, used new kiosks which worked for 7 out of 10 including sons girlfriend who had not travelled before. We did go through recheck for 3 as their receipts had a cross on. I know some have reported this process being done twice over, with some work to rule type approach but for me it was only for issues with taking finger scan. Grabbed bags, hit the tram and out. So great experience all round, even saw the Dreamliner at MAN ;-) Now just need to ask an EU261 compensation questions and complain about not getting my assigned seats...\n",

They offered me £30 compensation, it cost me £220 in phone bills trying to get someone to look for them. They actually make money from putting you on hold. I found several auction houses in London that sell off \"lost luggage\" and kept doing a search for records. 4 months later, guess what, they were selling off my records that they claim they could not find. On calling up the auction house, they read out a few titles and that confirmed that they were my records. No they were NOT my records they belonged to BA and there was nothing I could do but bid on them again in the hope that I would win back my own records. The ladies in the auction house were very helpful and I did win back my records for £60. 1.2 million bags were \"irretrievably lost\" by BA in 2007. Shocking really.\n",

The people next to us in the bag drop were also checking 2 bags per person. We did pay for Economy Comfort, but that doesn't seem to affect what bags you can check. The only logical reason I can see would be if the UK is not considered part of Europe and falls into the \"For all other international flights\" at the bottom of the chart.

      "My boyfriend and I made a trip to Spain(Hong Kong-Madrid and Madrid- Hong Kong). We flied with Aeroflot and had both trips scaling in Moscow. Both going(30th Aug) and coming back(15th Sep), the luggages were spot checked as the suitcase locks were open when we got the luggages back (which we think by Russia Airport Authority as this has never happened since I have transited and been traveling around to any other countries). The going trip to Spain, both suitcase locks were open, broken lock for my boyfriend's case which he bought a new suitcase in Spain later. However, the real disaster was actually the coming back trip!! When we picked up the luggage, we found out that both luggages were broken, there are also 2 breakage spots on my luggage itself, the luggage handle came off and the locks were totally forced broken(so my boyfriend lost totally 2 suitcases for this trip). I have locked them before check-in and my suitcase is the type that came with international lock that can be opened by international key in case the luggage would be spot checked by any airport authority so it should not be forced open in such manner! That aside, when we got home, I opened the luggage just to find out that the things inside were totally flipped over in a big mess! The zipped compartment inside was open and the clothes are all messed up(as messy as a 80% sale basket in the shopping mall), the wrapped present was torn open, wrapping paper and the pieces of present scattered around everywhere in the luggage. Furthermore, my boyfriend's mobile phone(old one with problem which we was thinking to get it fixed in China) and his suit (together with necktie and belt) were stolen! The box of mobile phone was left behind together with the torn open plastic suit bag but both of the items were no where to be found! I tried to call the airline but nobody picked up, now I'm waiting for the reply email which I don't know whether they will even cared to read. Frankly speaking, I have no hope that they will contact us back. So this post is only an example and a warning for you guys to be careful and choose the airline wisely (we bought it because it was the cheapest flight ticket, an obviously resulted as an expensive lesson). For us, this is the first and will be the last time we will ever fly with Aeroflot or transit via Russia. With what had happened, we would not hesitate to pay 100-200 EUR more to get a better flight that transit elsewhere!!!\n",

      "End of March 2012 I made a trip to Manaus, Brazil. It was my first experience with \"long distance travelling\". The flight was booked and payed trough Ebookers.be. The flight itself was made by TAP Portugal. The journey to Manaus was perfect, but on my return happened an unexpected problem. Checking in at Manaus airport for the flight Manaus to Fortaleza, flight made by the Brazilian company GOL, they refused to let me check in. My seat was reserved, but, it seemed that the ticket was not payed by TAP. Even showing my e-ticket and proof of my payment, they refused to let me board. It was at that moment not possible to contact TAP in Brazil or Ebookers. The only way to take that flight was to by another ticket at the GOL-gate, witch costed me 781,00 euro! Arriving at Fortaleza Airport, I adressed myself to the TAP office. They gave me a mailadress where I could make my complaint. Back home, I adressed my complaint first to TAP, but the only answer I received was that I had to fill in the form on their website, witch I did, without any further respons. Since I booked my trip trough Ebookers.be, I repeated my complaint to that company, also by filling in a form on their \"customer-service\" website. You receive an automatic answer with a registration-number and the promise they would answer within 48 hours. 5 days later, I still had no answer. I send them a reminder, but even 2 weeks later, there was no further respons. I send Ebookers another, rather angry mail, on witch they responded the same day with excuses for the delay and the answer that they transmitted my complaint to TAP and that I could expect a compensation by TAP for the extra cost I had to make. Now, 3 months further, I still have no answer or payment by TAP or Ebookers. I presume that mail with complaints are directly transmitted to the \"unwanted mail\" or the \"trash\" map! I don't know how to proceed further in this mather to get any positive answer or repons by either TAP or Ebookers. But it is certain that I cannot recommend these companys for any other trip or flight!\n",

She will be fine getting on the plane at each end as she will be able to take the buggy up to the entrance of the plane, but unfortunately it then goes into the hold and is put on the carousel at the other end.

      "I made the unfortunate mistake of booking an emergency trip to the UK thru Minneapolis to LGW with Northwest. In the past I always had good luck with MSP but apparently they have been in the midst of runway work and flights are delayed or cancelled willy nilly (although you can bet it's the smaller cities whose flights are cancelled), Couldn't get into Minn to connect with the UK flight and NW \"service\" was little help. Apparently this has been going on frequently, yesterday the flight got to Minn too late to make the connection. If we had been warned earlier in the day, we could have driven to MSP in 4 hours and made the connection. All NW would offer by phone was a late Thurs flight to Detroit that got into LGW on Friday far too late for us. This suggestion also made it clear that NW wasn't going to guarantee we would be able to get to MSP Thursday eiher. Luckily we listened to the business travelers in line and did not trust the info given by phone, so we stayed in line and the in-person clerk (who was also helping unload planes at the same time) was able to reroute us to get to LGW three hours earlier which gives us a good shot at making the services. It may take all of Thursday to get to Gatwick but at least it's a chance if it all goes well. To add insult to this, while on hold with NW, they were playing an ad offering bonus miles to fly into Msp!!! If they had any kind of conscience they would be warning potential passengers of the delays and they all should change their schedules to avoid these delays. Oh, but then they might lose business, better to have a captive angry passenger than no passenger at all. I have not flown United for quite a number of years since that summer period when they were also stranding passengers in Denver and Chicago. I'm afraid that I'll be avoiding NW, especially their Airlink, for at least that many years after this. I can't think of any other business that I have been lied to and manipulated by for years and years as much as by the airlines. There was a time when I really did enjoy traveling, but that was before the hubs, maximizing seat capacity, disappearance of snacks and cancelling flights to make sure the other flights have no empty seats.\n",

I already have my seat selections on United through the reservation process, but not on Swiss. I have the Swiss confirmation number from the United web site, but, when I go to the Swiss site, I am apparently not allowed to see or manage the Swiss segments on the Swiss website due to the codeshare.

      "I was surprised to discover recently that I am only a few hundred miles away from Medallion Status on Delta. I say \"surprised\" because I generally don't fly enough in a year to get the necessary mileage for any kind of airline status. However in this case I benefited from a couple of trips to the west coast earlier in the year, plus two sizable MQM bonuses that I received courtesy of my Skymiles credit card. I have some long haul trips planned for later this year and early next, so decided to have a go at a Mileage Run to get the remaining miles for the status upgrade. Since I'm new to doing Mileage Runs, I decided to try something not too terribly ambitious - just enough miles to push me over the threshold. I've read that ATL is not a great airport to base out of for this sort of activity, but I did find an inexpensive R/T flight to Louisville that departs on a weekday afternoon, has a short layover at SDF, and then returns to ATL by about 8:00 PM on the same day. It cost about $145 altogether and I'll get 1000 miles out of it - not such a great deal in terms of cost per mile, but for a first effort I guess it's not too bad (plus it's a small financial investment if I have to back out at the last minute out for some reason). Anyway, here's my question. My biggest concern with this is that something will happen in Louisville (delays, etc) and I will miss the return flight to Atlanta. Both flights have the same flight number so I am guessing it's the same physical airplane for both legs. Does anyone have any idea if that's a valid assumption? I figure worst case I can do a one-way car rental and drive home (6 hours) if I miss the return, but would obviously rather fly (note that I only need the outgoing miles for the status upgrade, so no real harm done if that happens). That's really all I wanted to know, I guess. I know that FlyerTalk is probably a better venue to discuss this sort of thing, but I am not active over there (yet!). My wife is very dubious about all of this and thinks I am crazy, so I am just trying to allay some concerns. Thanks for any advice you all can offer. -JimG\n",

So 11 hours later and from a different place. They do not arrange another flight to São Paulo, neither a Hotel. We paid everything from our own (USD 150 from hotels and taxis)and went to Buenos Aires without a granted flight to Sao Paulo. It was possible take a flight to Sao Paulo just in 23/06 at 17:55 from TAM Linhas Aereas paying from our pockets (USD 1000 each one). We lost meetings, and personal arrangements in Sao Paulo due to the cancelation. Furthermore we have a lot of stress (nobody grants us that it would be possible to come back to sao paulo). Aerolineas do not do anything to help us. For luck we had money to do everything from our own. We have all the vouchers and receipts to prove the extra spending. It was an unfortunate experience together Aerolineas and Argentina. Never more we would choose this wretched airline. Furthermore, we will charge everything (all the extra costs) from Aerolineas. If necessary we would contact ANAC and the court. I’m a current flyer (special member from LAN/TAM) and never happens to me.

My bag was supposed to be checked through to the Catania,and it was always going to go through the secure dogana area where it would be scanned, but the bag went missing in Rome so I was not with the bag when it was scanned.

As we are now Coeliacs (no Gluten) we just booked the basic meals eg Chicken and plain rice. Once on board the meals were served and thats when we noticed the ingredients list on the packaging (contains gluten) so we could not eat the food i explained to staff they said to contact customer services and explain. On arrival I contacted Airasia via the website and explained everything eg, The website states that some of the meals may contain gluten, When in fact ALL of the meals had gluten, so I requested a refund of the return flights pre-booked meals which was some 10 days away. This request was of course rejected but i was given a link to the site again to select and pay for new meals lol that of course i cant eat any. Plus Airasia have a 'no outside food policy' I had anticipated that the level of service from them would be zero, so we did bring some snacks. The moral of the story use yoru mastercard as I did and dispute the transaction on return then they wil actually listen as the Booking was made from the UK our rules apply regardless of the lack of clarity on the Airasia site so I will update the outcome, for me its not about the £20 its more about the priciple now so fight on ;)\n",

      "Just saw this from FlyerTalk and the SFO website - \"San Francisco International Airport (SFO) will conduct a series of temporary runway closures during 2013 to accomplish construction activity for federally-mandated Runway Safety Areas. These closures will primarily consist of weekend closures of either Runway 28L or 28R, which are the primary runways for arriving flights. Only one runway will be closed at any given time. During closures, the arrival rate at SFO will be reduced from 60 aircraft per hour to 30 aircraft per hour. Delays for flights originating within a two-hour radius of SFO are expected to occur during peak travel times. Peak times are between 9:00 a.m. to12:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Travelers are strongly encouraged to contact their respective carriers regarding any potential delays.\" flysfo.com/web/…updates The dates listed are ... Jan. 11-14, Jan. 18-21, Jan. 25-28, April 5-8, April 12-15, April 19-22, April 26-29 , June 25-26 and and June 27-28 . Runways 28-L and 28-R are used for long haul takeoffs and for virtually all landings. The important point to note is that flights to SFO originating at an airport within a 2 hour flying time, will be subject to delays. These airports cover most of the west coast, from San Diego (SAN) in the south to Portland (PDX - my home) in the north. Seattle is a 2hr15 flight from SFO, so may not be immune. These delays already happen when bad weather hits SFO, as flights from nearby airports are subject to flow control. Should bad weather and these closures hit on the same day(s) it could be big time problems. If you have a flight to SFO and an onward connection for these dates, as referenced above you'd be advised to contact your airline. If you're planning on connecting via SFO from a nearby airport on these dates, allow an enormous amount of contingency, and even consider avoiding SFO altogether.\n",

      "This is a terrible, fraudulent company that luers people in through cheap airline tickets. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. My partner and I bought two business class tickets to Belize from San Fransisco and discovered a week later that there were unauthorized charges on our credit card that added up to almost double of the original cost of the tickets. Not only did they try to double charge us but then changed our tickets to coach class on the returning flight. We've been hassling with them for a week to get these issues resolved and so far only one ticket has been changed and only half of the money they owed us has been paid back. After looking this company (aka Solar Tours, Cheapticketabroad.com, etc..) on the BBB website and reading other posts about these companies, we know we are not the only ones who have been scammed. The BBB gives them an F rating. They've had to change their name several times to try and hide the fact that they are a shady company. Doesn't get any worse than that. Does any one have more information or a contact number for this company?

EVery flight out of our city was cancelled. Not my fault. Not Aeromexico's fault. These things happen. So, I called them to see how they were going to handle it. They said a refund was not an option. Fine. Act of God, whatever. So they said they would rebook my flight at a different date but they were sold out until the end of the month. And oh, by the way, I would have to pay the difference between the original ticket price and they ticket price of a different date----which was $500 more than the original ticket price, because the only tickets they had available were during the high season. I think that's poor customer service, but okay. Fine. The guy said I had 10 months to redeem it. Well, I called back three weeks later to rebook it, and he said that I only had two days to rebook the flight, that time had passed, they were taking my money and they would not be giving it back. NO ONE told me this when I talked to them originally. They made it very clear I had up to ten months to rebook it at no charge except for any difference in the ticket price. I explained this and asked to speak to a manager or supervisor. The guy on the phone was *extremely* rude though I was trying to stay calm and cordial with him. I asked 4 times before he finally agreed to let me speak to a supervisor. At which time, he put me on hold and left me there for 45 minutes. Finally, I hung up and called back. The same jerk answered the phone. I tried asking to speak to a supervisor again, and he hung up on me. What. The hell. Do NOT book through Aeromexico for any reason. If there is any problem at all, even if it's not your fault. you're not going to get your money back no matter what you do. I'm out $1200 unless my bank agrees to reverse the charges.

I was caught in the Oh s$#% time frame of under 3 weeks and over 2 weeks so I could not make appointment at the Miami passport agency . I scrambled 2 and 1/2 weeks till travel date what should I do? I panicked, I read horror stories and read great stories online. What should I do I ask my self. Wait 1/2 a weeks to make a appointment and hope I can get one before my travel date. One of the passport agency worker actually in a way suggested I should wait and set a appointment. I was scared its almost june summer is here its travel season. If I wait I risk not getting appointment in time. Three phone calls to the passport agency and I get a old man Nice calming voice in my state of panic telling me to expediate it. At the time expediated was 2-3 weeks and the clerk at courts said its the 3 week mark. The passport agent told me do it, my response was what if I don't get it in time he stated \" I had a get out of jail free card.\" At 4 days prior to departure if the application is good I can request a emergancey appointment with the Miami agency.. This gave me the kick in the but to expediate it and the relief I had a back up plan.. I herd rumors that the passport agency is the only functional branch of government now I can say confidently that these people are efficient. It only took 7 days, thats right 7 days not business days but days to get it to my door. I right this so the people who are stuck on the fence at the 2-3 week mark and are scared, don't be scared. The passport agency will do what ever they can not to delay you. Suggestions don't forget to put travel date and send it threw clerk of courts or accepted post offices. These certified places make it alittle quicker than you just sending it, Best of Luck and I hope this helps someone in the same situation I was in. _=) Edited: 8:16 pm, May 28, 2016\n",

      "United decided to not go along with its plan to end complimentary hot meals in economy on some international flights. Hot meals will be included on all Trans-Atlantic and Pacifc international flights again from all UA airports in all classes. Here is the email: Dear Mr.(snip), Thank you for your direct, candid feedback on the test we had planned to launch in the fourth quarter for food choices on some of our flights. We heard you and have decided not to move forward with the test of offering customers buy-on-board options in United Economy on certain trans-Atlantic flights. We will continue to offer complimentary hot meals on those flights. The response from you and many of our corporate customers, even before we launched the test, told us what we would have undoubtedly learned had we proceeded - you value our hot meal service in economy class for international flights. In this environment, where higher costs driven by volatile fuel prices are now the norm, we must continue to tailor products and services so that we provide you with choices and competitive fares. As such, we will continue to be proactive in testing new ideas. On October 1, we will proceed with the test of new, complimentary options for United Business customers on three-cabin aircraft used for domestic routes, which represents 16 daily flights. Customers on these flights will receive complimentary fresh sandwiches, salads, breakfast, snack boxes or snacks, depending on the length of flight and time of departure. They will also continue to enjoy complimentary beverages, including beer, wine and cocktails. We will evaluate the results and determine next steps by the end of the year. It's also important to note that full meals will still be served on our p.s. transcontinental flights. Thank you again for your feedback. We will continue to listen and make changes that enable us in this environment to provide you with the choices you value. Sincerely, Graham Atkinson Chief Customer Officer\n",

      "Hi, An interesting article today from USA today's travel section-- which is essentially an encapsulation of a larger, more detailed article written by the Wall Street Journal-- that discusses historical airfares and what people pay today as compared to 1995 levels. While I've mentioned this before, I thought the article was interesting for two reasons.. First, it does confirm what I suspect most people know to be reality.. that being the **average** air fare paid today is in fact LOWER than what you paid **on average** back in 1995 when adjusted for inflation.. Again, this is an average and applies to only US carriers.. but I do think that it applies to most markets-- some more than others, but most markets.. But the more interesting thing that the WSJ author notes-- is that even when you add in checked bag fees and other fees that didn't exist as separate charges back in 1995 (the WSJ author quotes a figure of $21.66 for these fees in total) it's STILL cheaper.. 16% cheaper with the fees added into the comparison, 21% without the fees added..

      "Here is the description of my terrible experience with FlightNetwork: I needed to book round trip tickets to Copenhagen for 3 people. We searched Google flights for the best deal and found a round trip flight for $843 from Flight Network. Since we needed to book using 3 different credit cards, I called FlightNetwork for the booking to ensure that we all get the same price and availability. First, it takes the agent forever to find the flight I am talking about (even using the flight numbers). Then, the agent tells me that the price I am seeing is due to a “glitch” in the system but they would honour this price. I am put on hold for long periods of time in order for the agent to come to this conclusion. It is already 30 minutes that I’m on the call and I have no new information other than the information I already had accessed online in less than 2 minutes. I tell the agent I would like to book with 3 credit cards and apply a promo code (for $20 discount per booking). The agent then asks me for the credit card numbers. Without asking me for my promo code, she has already applied a random promo code that gives $10 discount. I was frustrated at the incompetence of the agent and the long wait times so I decided I would continue the transaction online. I hang up with the agent, go through the online booking system, put in my credit card, click on “Purchase Now”, only to get a pop up that says the online system could not confirm my fare. I refresh the page and suddenly the flight is showing up at $896. I call back 5 minutes after I’ve hung up with the agent the first time, and she tells me that flight prices have gone up. I now decide to proceed with the booking anyway as it is urgent enough for me to book this flight. Another 45 minutes goes by, again long hold times, and my 3 flights are now booked. I receive emails with details of the booking but no invoice. I told myself I would call the next day to ask about the invoice. The next day, I notice the flight is showing at $843 again! And, on top of that, when I log in to the Air Canada website to manage my booking, the purchase price is actually at $843. So when I call back FlightNetwork, I tell them about this and I also tell them that I can’t even confirm what has been charged because I never received an invoice. Again, more ridiculously long hold times - every time, I ask a question, the agent tells me to hold on, puts me on hold for 5-10 minutes and comes back throwing up an answer she received from someone else. What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question. Initially, the agent tells me that she says I was charged $843 mistakenly. I am so confused. Then, she comes back and says oh no, it was $896 that you were charged. Complete chaos!! She sends me the invoice which says that I am paying $285 for the flight and $611.57 in taxes totalling $896.57. Then I tell her that the flight is back to $843 on their website. She says she cannot see this price in their database. I am literally refreshing the page as I speak to the agent and am seeing $843. I had to send a screenshot of what I am seeing on their website to them to prove that I am seeing this price!! She then says that because the flight is book, she cannot refund the difference but can provide it as a credit due to their price drop protection. I was not satisfied with this but looked like I didn’t have another option so I agree and she tells me that it will appear in my account within 3-5 business days. It has been 4 and still nothing but we will see. During the call, I ask to speak with a supervisor and she tells me that the supervisor will basically tell me the same thing… The total time for this call was 1 hour. Then I finally see the charge on my credit card - I see 2 charges. One with the description AIR CANADA totalling $843 and another with description TASF totalling $53. I google TASF and find out this mean travel agent service fee. I am so furious now as they never informed me that this was part of the price they quoted to me!! It is not even detailed in the invoice. I tried calling and the agent tells me that this doesn’t need to be detailed to me, it is part of the total price but I am still not convinced. This is only $53 but the principle of the matter, I was not informed of the details of the charges to my credit card, let alone the absolutely horrible service, I am sure this is in violation of some consumer protection act or travel agents act. Overall absolutely terrible terrible nightmarish experience with FlightNetwork. Not worth the headache and lack of transparency. Embarrassing that this is a Canadian company.\n",

We booked extra legroom seats and we felt the cost was worth it. Seat Selection: This was done online as well and it was simple. My only complaint is that we wanted two aisle seats and it wouldn't let me. Online Check in: I checked in a week ahead of time and printed boarding passes. Again, simple and easy. Night before luggage drop: We dropped off our luggage the night before with no stress or problems. I love being able to do this. Flight: Boarding was on time and very efficient. We did take off about 20 minutes later than planned. The flight was comfortable. We had bought a Boots Meal deal at the airport before we went to the plan. So, we did not purchase anything on the plane. We booked extra space seats and they were good value for my tall husband. The flight is about 3 hours from Manchester. Luggage & Immigration in Naples: we disembarked quickly upon landing to a bus. At immigration, the lines went quickly. We had a little wait for the luggage and then off to our transfer. From landing to our transport heading to Sorrento, it took about 1 1/2 hours. The return trip was just as simple and easy. We were pleased with our flights and now look forward to our trip on the Dreamliner this summer.\n",

Although I certainly understand Boise (or as I call it, Spudville!) is NOT a travel hub of any sort, it just shouldn't be this complicated to buy a ticket online, without involving a travel agent! In looking at Korean Air, Cathay Pacific, etc--one cannot \"start\" from Boise, even though they are partners with airlines that do fly into Boise. I really don't want to travel on two separate tickets. I have also tried Matrix--which is usually very helpful in finding a good \"routing\" and price from Spudville. In the past I've found my itinerary, then just gone to the airline website to purchase the ticket. Worked like a charm for last two trips to Europe! With Bangkok, this isn't working--the fares are MUCH higher on the airlines websites than Matrix, and I can't enter Boise as a starting point.

We signed up for trip alerts and didn't receive any but one that said they were ontime. Instead they were 4 hours late leaving Toronto and did not notify or communicate this to anyone until 15 minutes before when we were supposed to board. They made us wait for over an hour for a voucher for Lunch and then we got $5, which doesn't buy much more than a coffee at Pearson International. We paid for Premium seats because we had heard the seats were tight and then ours seats were double booked. We were worried about lost bags and went with carry on. When we arrived there were people that had lost luggage, I felt especiaily sad for this young teenage girl who was in tears on the bus ride to the resort. Coming home was no better. Web check in wasn't even offered on the way back Delays again coming home and the sign at the gate continued to read on time, even though they were not. They forced us to check our bags or pay several hundred dollars to carry them on even though we had less then when we went down and the bags were standard carry size for any other airline. We arrived so late that we had to pay for a hotel stay at the airport when we got back. On the 7.5 hour flight down we had one drink service that happened 3.5 hours after we boarded.

My wife and I just returned from a round trip via Delta from Charlotte to Jacksonville, FL. We flew first class cheaper than a coach seat on AA. From the moment we stepped up to the ticket counter in Charlotte until we got our baggage back at the end of the trip, it was amazing to experience the difference in service. The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing. Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat, fresh blankets, pillows, and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground, and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles. Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings. The entire crew was dressed very sharply, smiled, and actually thanked us for flying with them. They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service. Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crews....it is common place on AA. It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable. On each leg of the trip, our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim. AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutes. Best decision we've made to switch our business to Delta.\n",

The inflight service on the flight from JFK (772-200LR) was pleasant and seats were comfortable and were flat for sleeping. The airline's grounds services at JFK is not efficient for a large group. There were no Pre-Boarding areas for Executive or Business classes at the gate. The ground servive at BLR was also very inefficient and transit service at BOM was HORRIBLE. The flight from BOM to EWR on 747 was acceptable with good inflight food service, but non-existent entertainment and the seats were not flat. The transit at Heathrow (a refueling and more passengers stop) was the most miserable experience in all our flying years....We would not recommend to anyone flying through Heathrow as transit passengers. Their security staff is rude and there is no concept of organized boarding at Heathrow. Incidentally, there is barely enough time to exit the plane with all your belongings, go through security and make it back to the gate before the plane is supposed to leave.

      "Bought tickets on Expedia for RT Albuquerque t o Cairo via Turksih Air for our family. Turkish Air flight was late leaving JFK. We would miss our connection to Cairo so they re-booked us on Egypt Air (much better airline than Turkish Air!!!!!) On our return flight, which we bought tickets for (and paid for and reserved seat assignments, frequent flyers miles numbers, special meals), we discovered Turkish Air re-sold our seats and I guess cancelled the reservation. The result was the absolute worst seats in the back of the plane, not sitting together as a family even though we were travelling with a child. Also, we apparently don't get frequent flyer partner miles with this airline either, even though the Turkish Air agent on the phone and the ones in the airport assured us we would. We will never fly Turkish Air again and will never use Expedia either. If you want to go to Egypt, use Egyptair. Much better everything---customer service, flight attendants, food, AND they are on time or actually leave early if everyone is checked in! Never, ever fly Turkish Air. Terrible\n",

The problem is that I've asked this question 3 times with 3 different telephone reps at Travel Guard Insurance and I've gotten 3 different answers. I don't think the telephone reps understand this either. My question is this: When buying the policy, you have to put down on the application \"trip cost.\" Using BA Avios points for a Business Class ticket, the taxes and fees which I paid were about $1100. (OUCH !!!) The first agent told me to insure the cost of the actual ticket. (I knew this wasn't correct so I called back.) The second agent told me I could only list the cost to re-deposit the points in case of cancellation. This would be $65 USD. I wanted to double-check, so I called back a 3rd time, and the 3rd agent told me to put down the cost of the taxes and fees. In case of cancellation, I would get the taxes and fees back from BA.

We've never used travel insurance because except on one occasion we've always booked our own flights, hotels, trains, etc. That said - I've noticed a number of posts on this and other boards gently chiding people who've encountered problems in their travels for not purchasing trip insurance policies.

      "Volaris charged me over $700 for my infant daughter to fly with them, despite the fact that it's against Mexican federal law to charge for an infant. I had purchased tickets for my wife, daughter, and myself online with no problems. Upon arrival at Zacatecas (ZCL) for our flight to Chicago Midway (MDW), they said \"the system\" wouldn't let them check her in because she's two years old (despite the obvious fact to the contrary according to her Mexican *and* US passports). They couldn't get \"el sistema\" to let them issue a boarding pass because we were within the month that she turned two (she was 1 year, 11 months). They gave us the ultimatum: buy a full price ticket or don't fly. Not wanting to miss Thanksgiving dinner, we caved. But, as they were trying to buy the ticket for her as an adult \"el sistema\" wouldn't let them because she was not yet two years old!!! They eventually lied, entered an older age, and gave us the Customer Service number and email address for a refund. Essentially the *same* thing happened on the return flight... except this time they said they had absolutely no record of her ticket and forced us to buy another one. Naturally, customer service at Volaris is a joke in English or Spanish. In Spanish, they'll talk down to you, tell you it was your fault, and stonewall you. They'll refuse to let you speak to a supervisor. In English, they'll sound very nice and helpful and then do nothing, saying they'll call you back after checking with the airport for more details. Surprise, surprise, they never call back. If you then call them back, the supervisor (if you're lucky enough to get one... usually the reps just refuse to connect you) will not take your call, leaving you on hold for hours. If you hang up and work your way through Customer Service to the same supervisor... he'll tell his reps to tell you \"he'll call you right back.\" Two months later, and many, many hours on the phone, still no refund. Next stop PROFECO? Anyone else have this problem? What's the next move (besides obviously never flying with them again and advising everyone I know to do the same)?\n",

      "Hi, has anyone had any problems with HMPO online form when submiting their passport application? I applied for my first adult passport in July/2014 by using the online form available. Approximately six weeks later I received a letter saying I needed to complete a whole new form, this time in paper form. I contacted HMPO and asked why, since my application was complete and with no errors. They told me it was because I had missed Section 4 (details on parents). I went back into the online form, this time taking screen shots with date and time, and surprise, surprise there was no Section 4 in the online version of the form. I was never given the opportunity to write my parents details. I repeated the process several times in different dates and managed to get to the end of the form (screen to complete payment and submit). I tried contacting them by phone, but they insisted that despite the problem I had to go through the whole process again. I tried complaining, had no replies. Phoned again several times, then they finally said they could not find my application, then later on they \"found\" it but that there was no way around it. As a result I have waited for my passport to be processed for more than 8 weeks now - and still no idea when it will be finalised. I read in a similar trip advisor forum (\"Problems with the Passport Office,dated April 2014) that some people, Miss B and Nanny503927 for example, were having similar problems. I would not recommend use of HMPO online form for new applicants... And i was wondering if anyone has had similar issues. Thank you\n",

I booked some flights and elected to pay by Direct Deposit to avoid the credit card surcharge. As my bank is the same as theirs the transaction was processed immediately. Two working days later when I checked my itinerary, it was flagged as pending, unpaid. As when I had originally made the payment it said that the booking would only be held for two days I was a little concerned and phoned their customer service department. When I eventually got through, after some discussion I was asked to send a copy of my bank's confirmation of payment, which I duly did. Later that day I found the itinerary was now marked as paid so I was happy enough with that. However, this morning a Jetstar rep called me to check that everything was now OK and ask if I had received my itinerary (which I had). Not only that, but she had to call four times before I was available to take the call, which I thought was pretty good follow up, I would have thought they'd give up after the second try. They did leave voice mail, but only to say they wanted to speak with me personally, so they also didn't take that out and call it good. I was impressed, better service than I expected.\n",

      "I have not flown internationally in a long time....or even domestically since the invention of the TSA. I therefore had some trepidation about the flight, figuring it would be a royal PITA, no food, and generally where the end would justify the means. Wrong. I chose British Airways Open Skies from Newark to Orly because I had always had good experiences with BA. Also, I liked the idea of a smaller plane with less people. It seemed to be a bit more civilized. I was not disappointed even though we traveled economy. The seats were leather and comfy, and not quite as narrow as some. Our seats were the first row in economy, so although not separated by a wall, there was a lot of leg space between our seats and the last row of business class. We were not treated as if we were the inferior class. We received iPads, a full meal which was quite good, as well as a small breakfast snack before landing...all at no additional cost. Upon the return we were two in three seats, which was terrific. We had a sizable snack, a full meal which was also quite good and another snack prior to landing. The flight crew (captain et al) on both flights were terrific....informative and very personable. The flight attendants were very pleasant, professional and helpful...and love the uniforms as they have a chic retro vibe. Along with the pillow and blanket we received a packet with eye shades, socks, and another item I can't recall. Boarding and disembarking were both a breeze although upon Orly arrival we did not have jetway access but had to disembark on the airfield where a bus waited to take us to the terminal. On the return to Newark we hit a wind shear upon touch down which the female pilot handled very admirably. Luggage retrieval was painless...again, due to far fewer passengers. One point...the 757-200 is a narrow body jet. Therefore the aisles are narrower than many other types of aircraft. Therefore, any bump in the air will cause you to bump the passenger in the seat if walking in the aisle, or be bumped if you are seated. Other than that, the flight was like flying used to be, when passengers were treated like humans, and not cattle. IMO, all,others airlines should,take a page out of the BAOS book. I would fly them again in a heartbeat. Now all they need to add is in flight WiFi, and the service would be perfect.\n",

      "I have read several other posts on here about Allegiant Airlines and Disabled individuals expecting to receive more services than they are actually due because of their disabled status. I want to make sure you know I'm not one of those people. When booking my trip I did request assistance from Allegiant with my luggage, moving through the airport and security, to the gate, and on and off the plane. I tried to be as specific as possible as to the assistance I needed since I was traveling alone. These requests were not out of line and should have all been provided by Allegiant. Instead, Allegiant asked my family member who was dropping me off at the airport to help me to my gate which was a huge inconvieniece for them. On my first leg the gate was changed before the flight and another passenger had to move me to the new gate. But that was nothing compared to how I found my wheelchair every time I received it back from Allegiant after landing. After the first leg, the left arm rest was broken off. I didn't say anything at that time thinking that it was just a \"things happen\" situation. I really lost it though when at the end of my second leg, as I was being wheeled down the ramp, the young man who was wheeling me down wheeled my left wheel partially on the edge of the ramp causing the rubber tire to come off my wheel!! Then he started telling me how it was \"normal wear and tear\". REALLY?!?! When my husband and I got back to our car we inspected the chair closer and found that the edge of the back of the chair had a rip in the vinyl!! It's going to cost me more to repair this chair than it will to just replace it. What makes me so angry is that no one says sorry. My husband worked for an entire day to make this chair fit my personality by painting it sparkly hot pink since I have to spend so much time in it. Now though, I'm house bound because they just didn't care to take care of something that is so important to me. I did contact them, I guess they have 30 days to respond.\n",

When I checked in at Melbourne Airport I had the misfortune to be quite ill with flu and on top of not feeling well I had problems with my ticket. Instead of being helpful and sympathetic the Australian staff working behind the counters sent me away 4 times to different counters to try and sort out my problem which took over an 1 1/2 hours. Once on board the plane I was put next to a small baby and on asking the cabin crew if I could be moved as I did not want to give the child my germs, I was rudely told that there was nothing they could do for me. All in all my flight from the moment of check in to when I landed was an absolute nightmare. Have other passengers had the bad luck of dealing with rude and unhelpful Qatar Airways staff?\n",

      "I`ll always remember when we went to China back in 2008, the weather in August was too hot for me but the country was fascinating and the Eclipse was fantastic : aerialsandtv.com/…ChinaEclipse Unfortunately BOTH our suitcase failed on the same trip ! And, significantly, the zips went on both of them. So we needed new cases, we wanted strong hard shell weatherproof ones (having seen what happens to soft cases left out in the rain......) and, most importantly, no zips. And we found them ! American Tourister \"Flite\" (Samsonite`s budget range). They`re not the lightest in the world but built like tanks, plastic tanks I grant you, but tanks none the less. You`ll always see loads of them owned by seasoned travellers on airport luggage carousels. They came with a 3 year guarantee, but 4 years later after loads of hard use we needed a spare part for one, it just screwed on and they just put it in the post, for free ! That level of customer service is rare indeed these days. Anyway, earlier this year a friend of mine wanted my advice on what suitcase to buy. I`ve seldom been so certain of any recommendation, buy the American Tourister hard shell suitcases we bought back in 2009, but guess what ? Yes you`re right ! They don`t do them anymore ! In fact they don`t do anything similar and neither does anyone else (well Samsonite do one model, but that was a bit out of her price range). The question is why are all suitcases on the market these days flimsy soft and zipped ? ! ? Edited: 4:15 pm, September 20, 2012\n",

Prior to take off in Perth we were joined in the row in front of us by 3 drunk men who from that moment on set about drinking the cabin dry. After an hour, the one in front of my wife suddenly decided to put his seat into a full recline position hitting my wife in the face. We complained and verbal hostilities arose. We were moved 5 rows back. This was not the end of our troubles. From that point onwards we were threatened contiunally by these men. This was pointed out to the crew. Approaching to land I was told by \"the leader\" that they would be waiting for me in the corridor. This was heard by a Stewardess. A terrifying experience all round. Nothing happened in the corridor but we were on edge continually. Luckily for us, they did not continue on our joining flight to Heathrow. I emailed a complaint to Malaysia Airways and 4 weeks later they have replied sending a 3 line email back saying thanks for my observations and they will review their practices on future flights. The questions is. Do I now leave it at that or is that the best I can expect from a 5 star airline ?????\n",

They are always packed with too few staff (counters & \"TSA\" checkpoints), the flights NEVER take off on time, you can't understand the PA system and a Coke costs 6 Euros. And, I have a problem every time I use Alitalia. They are famous for switching your seats if they have an Alitalia frequent flyer book after you who asks for your seats. They always give first priority to their own frequent flyers. It's happened to me three times now (most recently 9/14), so they still do it. You can go ahead book through Delta, but make sure that it's a Delta flight on Delta equipment. Otherwise, you're taking your chances.

      "First of all - let me say - I know baggage allowances exist for good reason - and that we should abide by them - This post is not about that - its about how in certain situations staff really make it hard for customers to like a brand. I was flying Ork-Birmigham on an ATR72 (double prop plane with limited overhead baggage space). I fly this route relatively often - and as often as not hand luggage is take from you and put in the hold. Also - as often as not this plane runs at least 30 minutes late. So I arrive in Cork and would prefer not to have to have bags checked - but they are as its a pretty full flight. C'est la Vie. The flight leaves late due to late inbound craft -(which is a BS excuse really - - a more honest one would be the craft was late because its on an end to end schedule with very tight turnaround times, and we stuffed up somewhere earlier in the day) So I land an hour late and then have to wait for my bags - C'est la vie. On my return leg - I decide to ask at check in should I check my bag - I get advised that if I do there will be a charge (at least 50% of the time that i fly this route I am forced to check it - which of course is free - but I prefer not having to check it). I inform the staff member (Ms Ragdish) that i have no desire to check it, but will it be taken off me. She asks me to present it for weighing - and as it weighs 11KG she says I must pay 40£ to check it. I offered to take something out but she stated that then my laptop case would be over weight. So I had to pay 40£ to have a suitcase taken off me that would have been taken off me anyway. I only offered as having flown the route many times I wanted to assist on making things run smoother. And this was how I was repayed What a lousy customer loyalty reward. Then the PLane ran 75 minutes late. Michael O'Leary from Ryan Air decided a year and a half ago that it wasnt a good idea to muck about as much on luggage restrictions - and moved away from it in favour of better customer services. Aer lingus have apparently decided to try and see if they can make that failed policy work. Can I ask the question of Aer Lingus - If you try to emulate his failed baggage policy, could I implore you to try and at least aim for his successful on time policy? (soap box dismantled)\n",

      "This is not an airline I thought I would ever use. However, I booked a short break and only at the end of the booking did the lady mention it was a Ryanair flight. (Thanks to those of you on this forum that pointed out Ryanair don’t actually permit this; thankfully we were fine). I spent forever obsessing about my hand luggage and in the end opted to take only a rucksack – was only staying 3 nights. As soon as I arrived at the airport I headed straight to their bag measurers to ensure it was the right size. Turns out it could have been double the size and it would still have been okay. However, I needn’t have bothered because no one checked the size or weight of the bag before boarding either of the flights. In fact, as far as I could see no one on either of our flights had their bags checked. I did wonder though if this was because of flight was running late because as we were queuing to board we could see people departing the plane. Funnily enough we taxied right on time and for the return flight we left about 10 minutes late. I spent ages entering the online check in details as there’s a charge for entering information incorrectly. Again, I needn’t have bothered as the guy barely glanced my passport as he tore my boarding pass. When we did get onboard there did seem to be a problem with some people’s luggage as there wasn’t room overhead for everything but they managed to squeeze cases under some people’s seat. The plane seemed clean as far as I could see and the seats were comfy. Only criticism was that the seats did not recline nor were there any pockets on the back of the seat in front of you to store newspapers etc. I didn’t purchase any drinks or snacks as I took my own on board. And the little interaction I had with staff was pleasant enough. Another slightly annoying things was that my mum, who travels on a Barbados passport, had to have her boarding pass stamped before departure or she’s refused boarding. They make this very clear for the departure flight but I didn’t think it was necessary for the return flight. Praise God I decided to check to be on the safe side because it turns out it needs to be stamped in both directions. So, the nightmares I had in the lead up to the flight were unfounded. However, there was a couple at our hotel who flew out on another Ryanair flight and were charged the £40 for being a kilo over weight. To me it begged the question of whether there was something they could have thrown away and purchased once they landed but hey. Would I fly Ryanair again? Probably not of my choosing but if I absolutely had to then I guess I would as long as I was careful to follow all their rules.\n",

I was very apprehensive and expecting some delays, but everything was fine. We flew out of the Hamilton, Ontario, terminal and it was great! So compact, no walking, just park the car, walk in, check in, and on the plane. Wonderful compared to Pearson. Arrived in Dublin, Ireland on time. Flight over was in an older aircraft purchased from an Icelandic airline. We bought economy no frills and it was pretty tight for leg room. If you have long legs, spring for the premier. Other than that, it was just fine - plane left and arrived on time. On the flight home, we got a \"free\" meal and non alcoholic drinks, even though it said on the website you needed to preorder the meals. The people that preordered got a different meal (beef or pasta dish). We got a type of chili with vegetables and a bun with a dessert. Can't say every flight will go as smoothly, but I hope this will help with some of the apprehension involved with this airline.\n",

      "Feb 2nd, 2008 I was at Newark/Liberty airport to pick up a puppy that was being sent to me from a breeder in Texas. Unfortunately this breeder used American Airlines to transport the dog. I had used the useless flight tracker to get updated on the status of flight 558 and tracked the \"Airway Bill/Confirmation number\" to track as well. I called American Airlines Cargo prior to going to the airport. The flight was scheduled to arrive early and I took my family to the airport to pick up our new dog. After waiting for well over two hours after the flight landed, the people representing American Airlines Cargo could not give any information other than \"we don't know where the dog is, there were no dogs on flight 558\". They offered NO direction or help other than asking people to leave the carge office. In fact all four people behind the counter disappeared into a side \"break room\" with a poor attitude and suggessted we call in a few hours to see if the \"packages\" were found. Disgraceful. There were 11 families waiting and as this dragged on with absolutely no communication there was obviously frustration. The solution for the American Airlines employees was to call the airport security. These were families with children waiting and this was an absurd way to handle the situation. I called the breeder who could not get any information. I called American Airlines twice from my cell phone, only to be told that the dog in fact was at Newark airport as the flight had landed with the dog was on it. Not true but this was the only information available. Clearly no one knew what was going on and there is a serious flaw in their tracking capabilities. The fact that an error was made was not the issue. The complete inability of anyone representing AA at the airport or on the phone to address the situation was beyond irresponsible. The people in the cargo office were rude, unprofessional and dismissive. In fact, as we waited there were people from other flights coming to claim pets that were also lost because American Airlines never bothered to put them on the flight. AA systems are dangerously flawed. The employees are incompetenent, don't care and the airline is incapable of being trusted to transport an animal, child or anything of value. These puppies and family pets were left unattended in small crates for an unhealthy amount of time, neglected by American Airlines. They truly think of animals as nothing more than cargo and have zero concern for the health and well being of any animal they are transporting. If they can not responsibly transport a dog, YOU are not safe on this Airline. They have obviously stopped caring at all and should do us all a favor by declaring bancruptcy and get out of a business that has clearly passed them by.\n",

      "Now I know the meaning of the bromide \"you get what you pay for\". Flew Zoom from JFK to Gatwick, allowing 4 hours to make a connection to a Ryanair flight to Dublin. The flight was 2 hours late to begin with, but the Zoom representative placated me when I expressed concern that I would miss my connection, telling me that Ryanair only charged GBP 20 to rebook. I arrived at Gatwick 5 hours late, Ryanair told me I was out of luck and had to buy a new ticket for an additional GBP 200 (about $400.00 and 20 times what I paid for the original Ryanair ticket). Zoom accepted zero responsibility for their late arrival although it wasn't due to weather or any other systemic delay. After several attempts to contact them, I don't expect them to address this issue. Never Again!\n",

      "Easyjet posted on their website that they were going to honour the baggage allowance that GB customers would have had (1 case up to 23 kilos) this was posted weeks ago and is still on there. They have now added another entry saying that GB customers will get 1 case up to 20 kilos and both of these conflicting items are still on their website. I phoned last Friday and they confirmed the 23 kilos was right, I phoned yesterday and they said it was 20 kilos and the lady had to look on line to find out what I ment, then she came back to me and said that the 23kilos was a mistake and they would only allow up to 20 kilos. When the sale went through and the e mail was sent out they say one thing and as soon as you confirm they move the goal post. I told them that it obviously not a mistake but a deliberate change of their mind. As our flight going out is still with GB and now coming back with Easyjet with 2 different allowances which is really annoying, as they also informed me that one case cannot be 22 kilos and another 18 which is even more annoying. I have printed off the website answer to the question which says that GB passengers will not have their baggage allowance changed, do you think I have a leg to stand on if I take this to the airport.

      "The topic of airfare price drops has been done to death I guess but I'll give it another whack. Is Air Canada the worst offender? I am not an experienced air traveller but I was very surprised to find the airfare for the same flights I booked in early February from Australia to Vancouver return (Sep/Oct travel) have dropped by 25% six weeks later! I booked the cheapest fare (economy tango) for my family on our first international trip and I chose Air Canada because it is a direct flight and we have limited time during school holidays. The airlines seem to know when it is holiday time and bump up the prices. I have to say 25% is a significant price drop for the same class seats on the same flights. I am disappointed at losing $2000 and it is an unfortunate lesson. If I could afford the higher fares I gather the tickets would be refundable and I would not lose out, except for the nasty cancellation fee. My tickets are not refundable and I am informed there is no option to rebook at the new lower fare. I wouldn't mind so much if the price drop wasn't so large. If this is a normal occurrence it seems booking with Air Canada is like spending money on a lottery ticket.\n",

      "My family and I booked 4 tickets to New York for a week long stay, a week cruise, and then reurn home. Given that the day the ship returns to port, we will also have to fly back home, I called British Airways and asked in the slim possibility that Internet will not be avaialble on board the ship (distance, technical problems etc) what can be done if anything to ensure that all 4 family members can be together for the long flight back home. It is a very remote possibility that Internet will not be available on board the ship, but who knows.... I just wanted to make sure that we do not have any unplesant surprises. To my dismay they said that airport check-in is possible but do not guarantee that we will all be seated together. They asked for a total of 200EUR to preallocate the seats. I would expect this from a low-cost budget airline but certainly not from BA. I did not ask for a ticket change or any other upgrade or service (like extra luggage or preferential seating) I should pay for, but paying 5000EUR for 4 tickets and then being asked for another 200EUR for the simplest of service, it really bothers me. In my opinion this is a \"nickel and dime\" practice at best. I wrote them an email about it, and they did NOT even respond to it. I would at least expect a typical answer from them. Are my expectations unreasonable (do not overcharge for services, replay to complaint emails)???? Thank you all, Andreas\n",

I'll try to keep this brief. Phx-PHL leg uneventful. Got to PHL and checked in at gate and big problem. They had to downsize the aircraft from a 767 to a 757 and were asking volunteers to give up seats. I had a HUGE event plannd in London next night I could not give my seat up. Finally they had enough volunteers and they tried to split me and my freind up. I said no way she is elderly and can barely walk and needs assistance with everything so they put us back together. Got to LHR safely. Had great trip. Flight back..huge overbook and again asking for volunteers, at least no aircraft downgrade. Left almost on time, not 1 seat to spare. Got to PHL and sat on runway for almost an hour no open gates. I had to reclaim my bag, go through security again, ran with my carryon and laptop to the gate and missed the jet by 5 minutes. I had to stay the night without any of my bags they had already been checked. No clean clothes, nothing. All toiletries sitting in Phx. Got small care package from airline with toothbrush, shampoo thats it. Cell phone dead because charger in suitcase.

      "Leaving in 3 weeks for a 14 day cruise with 3 day extensions before and after cruise--so about 3 weeks total. Flying from San Diego (commuter plane) to LAX where we fly British Air to Heathrow and then into Stockholm. Hope to pack in just carry on, not because we don't want to pay for luggage, but because on our last trip, through Heathrow, British Air lost our checked bag(s) in BOTH directions. The carry on suitcase, that I have used successfully in the past, is the 22\" from Costco with 2 wheels only. I did carry it on a year and a half ago on British Air without any problem. Also, it did fit into the sizing frame on an American Air domestic flight this past May, when the LAX porter said \"that bag is too big for a carry on!\" but I am concerned about whether British Air has a new size restriction for carry on bags. The bag measures 23\" from wheels to top, even though it is sold as a 22\". If we are going to have to check this bag after arrival at the airport, I might as well pack in a large bag and not have to worry about what I pack. What are your thoughts?\n",

On one occasion I was travelling with my wedding dress and I emailed ahead just to ask how they would advise I carry it.

When they asked us for our passenger information we provided them with the correct information regarding first and last names. However, when they sent our itinerary, my first name was misspelled. I usually write my name as 'Luuk', while my passport says 'Lucas'. I remember signing emails with Luuk, yet I also know that I gave the correct passport names when asked. When I was at Heathrow airport I first encountered that the name on my ticket didnt match my passport. At that point it wasn't to big a deal, but I got to fly anyway. I tried to change my name at the AIR New Zealand service desk, but they couldnt do it and said that the travel agent had to do it. I'm currently in Australia after stopping over in Hong Kong. I could make all flights with the wrong name, even if that sometimes led to skewed faces. I've contacted the travel agent (Travel Nation) and asked them if they could change my name, since I provided them with the correct names. They told me it couldnt be done, since I already started travelling. Instead the added a note, stating that my first name was misspelled. In the accompanying email (in which my first name was misspelled again as Luuc!!!!!) they stated that 'this is not a guarantee for the USA'. So now I'm getting a bit freaked. I'm sure that I will be able to fly to all my other destinations, but If I cant fly to the US, that would be awfull. Is there nothing that can be done?\n",

I have read reviews where members seem to have a pompous attitude to dress code and snub any form of casual sports wear. My son looks very respectable in his fashion wear and is clean and tidy. I have worked in office environments where business men dressed in suits are offensive due to their uncleanliness but because it is a suit and looks business it is deemed. Dress code is surely subjective for an airport lounge where people are meant to be in holiday mode! Shouldn't the fact that a person is be clean and tidy and respectful be more important than what line of attire they are wearing? I totally agree that a person should dress respectful in terms of not revealing too much flesh but reasonable length shorts and trainers...what is the problem? Maybe there should be a business lounge purely for business attire and an exclusive lounge for respectful people who can wear any fashion provided they are clean, tidy and respectful to others.\n",

In short, we have booked vacations through many on-line companies that are ethical. THis one is not so do not expect any client support from them..... I am writing today to tell you how disappointed I am in your misleading business practices and disgusted I am with your customer support (a common thread in many reviews for your company).

We used Cheap Caribbean last year to book a trip and we were charged Canadian funds (funds were at par) and because of this we assumed your company charges us in our currency. There is NOTHING on the website or at checkout to indicate otherwise. For example, even when we book with Hotwire US we are quoted at checkout USD meaning the final price states clearly USD. Cheap Caribbean does not specify anywhere on the website or on our ticket voucher you charge in USD. There is nothing in your contract either to indicate you charge in USD. We were pretty shocked when we were billed $450+ more than we were invoiced for on our credit card. When I called customer care indicating I expect a refund the differance I was informed by a robotic like human ...we are a US company we charge in USD. I could not get Bobby to understand the issue is not that you charge in USD, you don't tell your customers you charge USD. A call to the supervisor was a waste of time. He could care less. The LAST think a customer wants to here is \"we are not doing anything for you\". So, as a result of this I have filed a complaint with the BBB and had several conversations with my friends and coworkers telling them how misleading this company is and all I spoke to are shocked you do not indicate what currency you charge in. Your refusal to pay back what you should not have charged in the first place will cost you a lot of future business. Your lack of action speaks volumes about your business practices (shady) and you lack of interest in customer satisfaction. Also, you may want to have a supervisor train your service reps. When asked ``How are you`the response of `I am okay`is not professional at all. In addition, perhaps educate your staff that a .com company does not indicate you are US based. I work for a Canadian based company with a .com site. Then again, we are ethical and clearly indicate currency charged on our invoices.\n",

Passengers may only carry small quantities (max. 100 ml per container) of liquids, gels and aerosols in their hand baggage. The packaging of these products must also meet specific requirements. This applies for all passengers departing from or catching connecting flights at airports within the European Union. The new rules apply for liquids such as water and other drinks, but also extend to gels, pastes, lotions, and the contents of aerosols. This includes toiletries such as toothpaste, shaving cream, hair gel, lip gloss, facial creams, mascara and liquid lip balms. These are the rules for liquids in your hand luggage: You can only bring on liquids and gels in containers of no more than 100 millilitres.

      "Just got back from NY. What a wonderful airline. Super quick check in and lounge at Luton. Seats extremely comfortable, with many positions + massage facility. Free drinks and good food with extremely pleasant staff. I can't fault this airline for value for money!! I understand they are having a new lounge and check in at Newark in the near future. We had to spend 7 hours there on our way back and as there is no left baggage facility at the airport and the Silverjet lounge didn't open until midday we couldn't get in to NY for the day which was our intention. However, that is hardly Silverjet's fault and as I understand they are shortly starting another flight to NY presumably the check in will be open for more hours. Anyway the lounge was perfectly comfortable, with plenty of food and drinks should one need it. All in all a great experience and we shall certainly never travel to NY any other way.\n",

      "Beware what you get with budget airlines ... you probably will get what you pay for --- or in my case less. Flew Spirit Airlines from New York to Myrtle Beach and back last week with my wife and two-year old. Of course with kids (especially with safety seats that have to be in window seat to prevent blocking the egress path) I knew we'd be ponying up a significant chunk of change for baggage charges and pre-paid seat assignments. Flights were delayed, lines were long, ground staff was overworked and, with exception of one nice man, rude ... but figured you get what you pay for. Little did I know, you can actually get less than you paid for --- on the return flight the Spirit Airlines computer system was down in Myrtle Beach --- causing in addition to very long lines (always fun with a 2-year old), the loss of all information on who pre-paid for seats and baggage so it would be open seating. Annoying, but we were informed that all baggage would be free and anyone pre-paying for baggage or seat assignments would get a refund by calling the 1-800 number. Other than asking twice for the 1-800 number and never getting it, we did arrive safely in NY two hours late which is not horrible for LaGuardia. However, upon returning and calling the 1-800 number I was informed that since I did check luggage and did use 3 seats - I would not have any money refunded. So you can get less that what you paid for --- even on a budget airline.\n",

Obviously you don't expect or get full service on a short island hop, but it's quite adequate. There may be something in the WI culture (or LIAT training) which doesn't generate an instant but synthetic 'have a nice day' welcome but, if you engage with the staff, my experience was that you receive a warm & informed response.

      "Fore warned is fore armed - on a recent vacation to Jamaica my girlfriend became seriously ill and had to be put into a hospital (very frightening as you can imagine) However, when she was released to fly the next day I called Air Jamaica and was told the change fee would be $150 each. While high I know most airlines charge for this so I said OK. It was then that the reservations clerk said - Oh this is a non-stop flight so it will be $280 to re-book. AS we had just come through a very trying experience I was in no position to change planes in Kingston. I wrote to Air Jamaica and they have never written back. Further there is no way to get in touch with a human reservations clerk in the US. Not a very good situation. I also went on a few travel review sites seems that I am one of many people who have had a bad experience with this airline. My advice is to stay clear - for sure I and my friends will not use them again.\n",

      "Hi, I'm wondering if it is possible to change the 'return' round trip flights to another departure location?... I originally bought the round trip tickets: \"Toronto->China\" and \"China->Toronto\". In between I'm also planning on going to other nearby countries(Hongkong, Taiwan, Japan). I haven't bought other tickets yet, including the last flight from \"Japan->China\" (the one I'm trying to avoid buying right now) The reason that I bought the roundtrip instead of one way was because originally I was planning on going back to China again after my trips for couple weeks then return to Toronto. But right now something came up and I will have to return early... Basically, I'm asking if there's a way to change my return roundtrip flight from \"china->toronto\" to \"japan->toronto\"? so I won't have to buy another ticket from japan to china just to get on the return flight. :( Please let me know what would be the best option for me.

      "Flying to Orlando from Manchester I booked 2 exit seats to get the extra leg room - row 49, seats J+K. 49 H+J had acres of leg room, but 49K had virtually no leg room! The reason is that the exit door has a huge box in front of it, presumably to store the slide to be used in an emergency. Since this is right in front of seat 49K, there is almost no leg room - it is worse than the normal seats! I complained to the steward, who said that there was nothing he could do but to log it as an incident. Fortunately for us, there was no-one sitting in seat 49H so we used H+J and had a great flight - but it could have been much worse. I have written to VA to get my £35 fee refunded - there is no reason to charge extra to get LESS legroom! Robin\n",

      "Flew yesterday from Manchester to Orlando. Routing was originally via Atlanta with 4 hour layover prior to onward to MCO. 10 pax with reserved seating in economy. All pretty routine. Half of party arrives at MAN and calls me as checking out hotel, Atlanta flight overbooked. Heart sinks as travelling first time where it is just me with three sons, and sons girlfriend. So as I am mentally thinking EU261 rules, this is quickly followed up by they want to know if we are willing to switch to non stop flight leaving 30 minutes later. Heck yes, especially with a PE upgrade thrown in. 747-400 (Barbarella): great IFE, pretty good food (chicken well spicy must have read the tomato juice experiment), excellent attentive service. Seat are good pitch, but for me are not the most comfortable with headrest adjustment poor. Economy on way home is going too be a let down for the kids, hey ho. MCO arrival was excellent. We were an hour from wheels down to driving out the rental car garage. Immigration was empty, used new kiosks which worked for 7 out of 10 including sons girlfriend who had not travelled before. We did go through recheck for 3 as their receipts had a cross on. I know some have reported this process being done twice over, with some work to rule type approach but for me it was only for issues with taking finger scan. Grabbed bags, hit the tram and out. So great experience all round, even saw the Dreamliner at MAN ;-) Now just need to ask an EU261 compensation questions and complain about not getting my assigned seats...\n",

They offered me £30 compensation, it cost me £220 in phone bills trying to get someone to look for them. They actually make money from putting you on hold. I found several auction houses in London that sell off \"lost luggage\" and kept doing a search for records. 4 months later, guess what, they were selling off my records that they claim they could not find. On calling up the auction house, they read out a few titles and that confirmed that they were my records. No they were NOT my records they belonged to BA and there was nothing I could do but bid on them again in the hope that I would win back my own records. The ladies in the auction house were very helpful and I did win back my records for £60. 1.2 million bags were \"irretrievably lost\" by BA in 2007. Shocking really.\n",

When I look it up on Delta's website, it says from the US to Europe you get 1 free checked bag. delta.com/content/… We did actually check 2 bags for one of us and one for the other and were not charged. The people next to us in the bag drop were also checking 2 bags per person. We did pay for Economy Comfort, but that doesn't seem to affect what bags you can check. The only logical reason I can see would be if the UK is not considered part of Europe and falls into the \"For all other international flights\" at the bottom of the chart.

      "My boyfriend and I made a trip to Spain(Hong Kong-Madrid and Madrid- Hong Kong). We flied with Aeroflot and had both trips scaling in Moscow. Both going(30th Aug) and coming back(15th Sep), the luggages were spot checked as the suitcase locks were open when we got the luggages back (which we think by Russia Airport Authority as this has never happened since I have transited and been traveling around to any other countries). The going trip to Spain, both suitcase locks were open, broken lock for my boyfriend's case which he bought a new suitcase in Spain later. However, the real disaster was actually the coming back trip!! When we picked up the luggage, we found out that both luggages were broken, there are also 2 breakage spots on my luggage itself, the luggage handle came off and the locks were totally forced broken(so my boyfriend lost totally 2 suitcases for this trip). I have locked them before check-in and my suitcase is the type that came with international lock that can be opened by international key in case the luggage would be spot checked by any airport authority so it should not be forced open in such manner! That aside, when we got home, I opened the luggage just to find out that the things inside were totally flipped over in a big mess! The zipped compartment inside was open and the clothes are all messed up(as messy as a 80% sale basket in the shopping mall), the wrapped present was torn open, wrapping paper and the pieces of present scattered around everywhere in the luggage. Furthermore, my boyfriend's mobile phone(old one with problem which we was thinking to get it fixed in China) and his suit (together with necktie and belt) were stolen! The box of mobile phone was left behind together with the torn open plastic suit bag but both of the items were no where to be found! I tried to call the airline but nobody picked up, now I'm waiting for the reply email which I don't know whether they will even cared to read. Frankly speaking, I have no hope that they will contact us back. So this post is only an example and a warning for you guys to be careful and choose the airline wisely (we bought it because it was the cheapest flight ticket, an obviously resulted as an expensive lesson). For us, this is the first and will be the last time we will ever fly with Aeroflot or transit via Russia. With what had happened, we would not hesitate to pay 100-200 EUR more to get a better flight that transit elsewhere!!!\n",

      "End of March 2012 I made a trip to Manaus, Brazil. It was my first experience with \"long distance travelling\". The flight was booked and payed trough Ebookers.be. The flight itself was made by TAP Portugal. The journey to Manaus was perfect, but on my return happened an unexpected problem. Checking in at Manaus airport for the flight Manaus to Fortaleza, flight made by the Brazilian company GOL, they refused to let me check in. My seat was reserved, but, it seemed that the ticket was not payed by TAP. Even showing my e-ticket and proof of my payment, they refused to let me board. It was at that moment not possible to contact TAP in Brazil or Ebookers. The only way to take that flight was to by another ticket at the GOL-gate, witch costed me 781,00 euro! Arriving at Fortaleza Airport, I adressed myself to the TAP office. They gave me a mailadress where I could make my complaint. Back home, I adressed my complaint first to TAP, but the only answer I received was that I had to fill in the form on their website, witch I did, without any further respons. Since I booked my trip trough Ebookers.be, I repeated my complaint to that company, also by filling in a form on their \"customer-service\" website. You receive an automatic answer with a registration-number and the promise they would answer within 48 hours. 5 days later, I still had no answer. I send them a reminder, but even 2 weeks later, there was no further respons. I send Ebookers another, rather angry mail, on witch they responded the same day with excuses for the delay and the answer that they transmitted my complaint to TAP and that I could expect a compensation by TAP for the extra cost I had to make. Now, 3 months further, I still have no answer or payment by TAP or Ebookers. I presume that mail with complaints are directly transmitted to the \"unwanted mail\" or the \"trash\" map! I don't know how to proceed further in this mather to get any positive answer or repons by either TAP or Ebookers. But it is certain that I cannot recommend these companys for any other trip or flight!\n",

      "My daughter will be travelling Gatwick/Malaga on her own with her baby who will be 18 months old. She will be taking hold luggage and a small backpack as cabin baggage. She will be fine getting on the plane at each end as she will be able to take the buggy up to the entrance of the plane, but unfortunately it then goes into the hold and is put on the carousel at the other end. Her problem will be how to manage the long walks when departing. The baby is already very heavy and although can walk a bit, will not be able to walk long distances. She is too heavy for my daughter to carry through to security. Has anyone else had this problem? I was thinking of her using special assistance but that really for disabled passengers.

      "I made the unfortunate mistake of booking an emergency trip to the UK thru Minneapolis to LGW with Northwest. In the past I always had good luck with MSP but apparently they have been in the midst of runway work and flights are delayed or cancelled willy nilly (although you can bet it's the smaller cities whose flights are cancelled), Couldn't get into Minn to connect with the UK flight and NW \"service\" was little help. Apparently this has been going on frequently, yesterday the flight got to Minn too late to make the connection. If we had been warned earlier in the day, we could have driven to MSP in 4 hours and made the connection. All NW would offer by phone was a late Thurs flight to Detroit that got into LGW on Friday far too late for us. This suggestion also made it clear that NW wasn't going to guarantee we would be able to get to MSP Thursday eiher. Luckily we listened to the business travelers in line and did not trust the info given by phone, so we stayed in line and the in-person clerk (who was also helping unload planes at the same time) was able to reroute us to get to LGW three hours earlier which gives us a good shot at making the services. It may take all of Thursday to get to Gatwick but at least it's a chance if it all goes well. To add insult to this, while on hold with NW, they were playing an ad offering bonus miles to fly into Msp!!! If they had any kind of conscience they would be warning potential passengers of the delays and they all should change their schedules to avoid these delays. Oh, but then they might lose business, better to have a captive angry passenger than no passenger at all. I have not flown United for quite a number of years since that summer period when they were also stranding passengers in Denver and Chicago. I'm afraid that I'll be avoiding NW, especially their Airlink, for at least that many years after this. I can't think of any other business that I have been lied to and manipulated by for years and years as much as by the airlines. There was a time when I really did enjoy traveling, but that was before the hubs, maximizing seat capacity, disappearance of snacks and cancelling flights to make sure the other flights have no empty seats.\n",

I already have my seat selections on United through the reservation process, but not on Swiss. I have the Swiss confirmation number from the United web site, but, when I go to the Swiss site, I am apparently not allowed to see or manage the Swiss segments on the Swiss website due to the codeshare. I could use some enlightenment on the process for online check-in on both outbound and return flights and seat selection for the Swiss legs so your input much appreciated.

      "I was surprised to discover recently that I am only a few hundred miles away from Medallion Status on Delta. I say \"surprised\" because I generally don't fly enough in a year to get the necessary mileage for any kind of airline status. However in this case I benefited from a couple of trips to the west coast earlier in the year, plus two sizable MQM bonuses that I received courtesy of my Skymiles credit card. I have some long haul trips planned for later this year and early next, so decided to have a go at a Mileage Run to get the remaining miles for the status upgrade. Since I'm new to doing Mileage Runs, I decided to try something not too terribly ambitious - just enough miles to push me over the threshold. I've read that ATL is not a great airport to base out of for this sort of activity, but I did find an inexpensive R/T flight to Louisville that departs on a weekday afternoon, has a short layover at SDF, and then returns to ATL by about 8:00 PM on the same day. It cost about $145 altogether and I'll get 1000 miles out of it - not such a great deal in terms of cost per mile, but for a first effort I guess it's not too bad (plus it's a small financial investment if I have to back out at the last minute out for some reason). Anyway, here's my question. My biggest concern with this is that something will happen in Louisville (delays, etc) and I will miss the return flight to Atlanta. Both flights have the same flight number so I am guessing it's the same physical airplane for both legs. Does anyone have any idea if that's a valid assumption? I figure worst case I can do a one-way car rental and drive home (6 hours) if I miss the return, but would obviously rather fly (note that I only need the outgoing miles for the status upgrade, so no real harm done if that happens). That's really all I wanted to know, I guess. I know that FlyerTalk is probably a better venue to discuss this sort of thing, but I am not active over there (yet!). My wife is very dubious about all of this and thinks I am crazy, so I am just trying to allay some concerns. Thanks for any advice you all can offer. -JimG\n",

Due to the cancelation, we miss our flight from Gol Linhas Areas (from Cordoba to Sao Paulo). After 3 hours waiting, the aerolineas employees schedule a flight to Buenos Aieres in 23/06 at 06:00. So 11 hours later and from a different place. They do not arrange another flight to São Paulo, neither a Hotel. We paid everything from our own (USD 150 from hotels and taxis)and went to Buenos Aires without a granted flight to Sao Paulo. It was possible take a flight to Sao Paulo just in 23/06 at 17:55 from TAM Linhas Aereas paying from our pockets (USD 1000 each one). We lost meetings, and personal arrangements in Sao Paulo due to the cancelation. Furthermore we have a lot of stress (nobody grants us that it would be possible to come back to sao paulo). Aerolineas do not do anything to help us. For luck we had money to do everything from our own. We have all the vouchers and receipts to prove the extra spending. It was an unfortunate experience together Aerolineas and Argentina. Never more we would choose this wretched airline. Furthermore, we will charge everything (all the extra costs) from Aerolineas. If necessary we would contact ANAC and the court. I’m a current flyer (special member from LAN/TAM) and never happens to me.

My bag was supposed to be checked through to the Catania,and it was always going to go through the secure dogana area where it would be scanned, but the bag went missing in Rome so I was not with the bag when it was scanned.

      "Hi we recently arrived back from a trip and took flights with Airasia form KUL to CEB we had pre-booked meals for both flights along with exit seats. As we are now Coeliacs (no Gluten) we just booked the basic meals eg Chicken and plain rice. Once on board the meals were served and thats when we noticed the ingredients list on the packaging (contains gluten) so we could not eat the food i explained to staff they said to contact customer services and explain. On arrival I contacted Airasia via the website and explained everything eg, The website states that some of the meals may contain gluten, When in fact ALL of the meals had gluten, so I requested a refund of the return flights pre-booked meals which was some 10 days away. This request was of course rejected but i was given a link to the site again to select and pay for new meals lol that of course i cant eat any. Plus Airasia have a 'no outside food policy' I had anticipated that the level of service from them would be zero, so we did bring some snacks. The moral of the story use yoru mastercard as I did and dispute the transaction on return then they wil actually listen as the Booking was made from the UK our rules apply regardless of the lack of clarity on the Airasia site so I will update the outcome, for me its not about the £20 its more about the priciple now so fight on ;)\n",

      "Just saw this from FlyerTalk and the SFO website - \"San Francisco International Airport (SFO) will conduct a series of temporary runway closures during 2013 to accomplish construction activity for federally-mandated Runway Safety Areas. These closures will primarily consist of weekend closures of either Runway 28L or 28R, which are the primary runways for arriving flights. Only one runway will be closed at any given time. During closures, the arrival rate at SFO will be reduced from 60 aircraft per hour to 30 aircraft per hour. Delays for flights originating within a two-hour radius of SFO are expected to occur during peak travel times. Peak times are between 9:00 a.m. to12:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Travelers are strongly encouraged to contact their respective carriers regarding any potential delays.\" flysfo.com/web/…updates The dates listed are ... Jan. 11-14, Jan. 18-21, Jan. 25-28, April 5-8, April 12-15, April 19-22, April 26-29 , June 25-26 and and June 27-28 . Runways 28-L and 28-R are used for long haul takeoffs and for virtually all landings. The important point to note is that flights to SFO originating at an airport within a 2 hour flying time, will be subject to delays. These airports cover most of the west coast, from San Diego (SAN) in the south to Portland (PDX - my home) in the north. Seattle is a 2hr15 flight from SFO, so may not be immune. These delays already happen when bad weather hits SFO, as flights from nearby airports are subject to flow control. Should bad weather and these closures hit on the same day(s) it could be big time problems. If you have a flight to SFO and an onward connection for these dates, as referenced above you'd be advised to contact your airline. If you're planning on connecting via SFO from a nearby airport on these dates, allow an enormous amount of contingency, and even consider avoiding SFO altogether.\n",

      "This is a terrible, fraudulent company that luers people in through cheap airline tickets. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. My partner and I bought two business class tickets to Belize from San Fransisco and discovered a week later that there were unauthorized charges on our credit card that added up to almost double of the original cost of the tickets. Not only did they try to double charge us but then changed our tickets to coach class on the returning flight. We've been hassling with them for a week to get these issues resolved and so far only one ticket has been changed and only half of the money they owed us has been paid back. After looking this company (aka Solar Tours, Cheapticketabroad.com, etc..) on the BBB website and reading other posts about these companies, we know we are not the only ones who have been scammed. The BBB gives them an F rating. They've had to change their name several times to try and hide the fact that they are a shady company. Doesn't get any worse than that. Does any one have more information or a contact number for this company?

EVery flight out of our city was cancelled. Not my fault. Not Aeromexico's fault. These things happen. So, I called them to see how they were going to handle it. They said a refund was not an option. Fine. Act of God, whatever. So they said they would rebook my flight at a different date but they were sold out until the end of the month. And oh, by the way, I would have to pay the difference between the original ticket price and they ticket price of a different date----which was $500 more than the original ticket price, because the only tickets they had available were during the high season. I think that's poor customer service, but okay. Fine. The guy said I had 10 months to redeem it. Well, I called back three weeks later to rebook it, and he said that I only had two days to rebook the flight, that time had passed, they were taking my money and they would not be giving it back. NO ONE told me this when I talked to them originally. They made it very clear I had up to ten months to rebook it at no charge except for any difference in the ticket price. I explained this and asked to speak to a manager or supervisor. The guy on the phone was *extremely* rude though I was trying to stay calm and cordial with him. I asked 4 times before he finally agreed to let me speak to a supervisor. At which time, he put me on hold and left me there for 45 minutes. Finally, I hung up and called back. The same jerk answered the phone. I tried asking to speak to a supervisor again, and he hung up on me. What. The hell. Do NOT book through Aeromexico for any reason. If there is any problem at all, even if it's not your fault. you're not going to get your money back no matter what you do. I'm out $1200 unless my bank agrees to reverse the charges.

      "I wanted to pass on my experience to travelers trying to get a passport in under 3 weeks from travel date. I was caught in the Oh s$#% time frame of under 3 weeks and over 2 weeks so I could not make appointment at the Miami passport agency . I scrambled 2 and 1/2 weeks till travel date what should I do? I panicked, I read horror stories and read great stories online. What should I do I ask my self. Wait 1/2 a weeks to make a appointment and hope I can get one before my travel date. One of the passport agency worker actually in a way suggested I should wait and set a appointment. I was scared its almost june summer is here its travel season. If I wait I risk not getting appointment in time. Three phone calls to the passport agency and I get a old man Nice calming voice in my state of panic telling me to expediate it. At the time expediated was 2-3 weeks and the clerk at courts said its the 3 week mark. The passport agent told me do it, my response was what if I don't get it in time he stated \" I had a get out of jail free card.\" At 4 days prior to departure if the application is good I can request a emergancey appointment with the Miami agency.. This gave me the kick in the but to expediate it and the relief I had a back up plan.. I herd rumors that the passport agency is the only functional branch of government now I can say confidently that these people are efficient. It only took 7 days, thats right 7 days not business days but days to get it to my door. I right this so the people who are stuck on the fence at the 2-3 week mark and are scared, don't be scared. The passport agency will do what ever they can not to delay you. Suggestions don't forget to put travel date and send it threw clerk of courts or accepted post offices. These certified places make it alittle quicker than you just sending it, Best of Luck and I hope this helps someone in the same situation I was in. _=) Edited: 8:16 pm, May 28, 2016\n",

      "United decided to not go along with its plan to end complimentary hot meals in economy on some international flights. Hot meals will be included on all Trans-Atlantic and Pacifc international flights again from all UA airports in all classes. Here is the email: Dear Mr.(snip), Thank you for your direct, candid feedback on the test we had planned to launch in the fourth quarter for food choices on some of our flights. We heard you and have decided not to move forward with the test of offering customers buy-on-board options in United Economy on certain trans-Atlantic flights. We will continue to offer complimentary hot meals on those flights. The response from you and many of our corporate customers, even before we launched the test, told us what we would have undoubtedly learned had we proceeded - you value our hot meal service in economy class for international flights. In this environment, where higher costs driven by volatile fuel prices are now the norm, we must continue to tailor products and services so that we provide you with choices and competitive fares. As such, we will continue to be proactive in testing new ideas. On October 1, we will proceed with the test of new, complimentary options for United Business customers on three-cabin aircraft used for domestic routes, which represents 16 daily flights. Customers on these flights will receive complimentary fresh sandwiches, salads, breakfast, snack boxes or snacks, depending on the length of flight and time of departure. They will also continue to enjoy complimentary beverages, including beer, wine and cocktails. We will evaluate the results and determine next steps by the end of the year. It's also important to note that full meals will still be served on our p.s. transcontinental flights. Thank you again for your feedback. We will continue to listen and make changes that enable us in this environment to provide you with the choices you value. Sincerely, Graham Atkinson Chief Customer Officer\n",

      "Hi, An interesting article today from USA today's travel section-- which is essentially an encapsulation of a larger, more detailed article written by the Wall Street Journal-- that discusses historical airfares and what people pay today as compared to 1995 levels. While I've mentioned this before, I thought the article was interesting for two reasons.. First, it does confirm what I suspect most people know to be reality.. that being the **average** air fare paid today is in fact LOWER than what you paid **on average** back in 1995 when adjusted for inflation.. Again, this is an average and applies to only US carriers.. but I do think that it applies to most markets-- some more than others, but most markets.. But the more interesting thing that the WSJ author notes-- is that even when you add in checked bag fees and other fees that didn't exist as separate charges back in 1995 (the WSJ author quotes a figure of $21.66 for these fees in total) it's STILL cheaper.. 16% cheaper with the fees added into the comparison, 21% without the fees added..

      "Here is the description of my terrible experience with FlightNetwork: I needed to book round trip tickets to Copenhagen for 3 people. We searched Google flights for the best deal and found a round trip flight for $843 from Flight Network. Since we needed to book using 3 different credit cards, I called FlightNetwork for the booking to ensure that we all get the same price and availability. First, it takes the agent forever to find the flight I am talking about (even using the flight numbers). Then, the agent tells me that the price I am seeing is due to a “glitch” in the system but they would honour this price. I am put on hold for long periods of time in order for the agent to come to this conclusion. It is already 30 minutes that I’m on the call and I have no new information other than the information I already had accessed online in less than 2 minutes. I tell the agent I would like to book with 3 credit cards and apply a promo code (for $20 discount per booking). The agent then asks me for the credit card numbers. Without asking me for my promo code, she has already applied a random promo code that gives $10 discount. I was frustrated at the incompetence of the agent and the long wait times so I decided I would continue the transaction online. I hang up with the agent, go through the online booking system, put in my credit card, click on “Purchase Now”, only to get a pop up that says the online system could not confirm my fare. I refresh the page and suddenly the flight is showing up at $896. I call back 5 minutes after I’ve hung up with the agent the first time, and she tells me that flight prices have gone up. I now decide to proceed with the booking anyway as it is urgent enough for me to book this flight. Another 45 minutes goes by, again long hold times, and my 3 flights are now booked. I receive emails with details of the booking but no invoice. I told myself I would call the next day to ask about the invoice. The next day, I notice the flight is showing at $843 again! And, on top of that, when I log in to the Air Canada website to manage my booking, the purchase price is actually at $843. So when I call back FlightNetwork, I tell them about this and I also tell them that I can’t even confirm what has been charged because I never received an invoice. Again, more ridiculously long hold times - every time, I ask a question, the agent tells me to hold on, puts me on hold for 5-10 minutes and comes back throwing up an answer she received from someone else. What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question. Initially, the agent tells me that she says I was charged $843 mistakenly. I am so confused. Then, she comes back and says oh no, it was $896 that you were charged. Complete chaos!! She sends me the invoice which says that I am paying $285 for the flight and $611.57 in taxes totalling $896.57. Then I tell her that the flight is back to $843 on their website. She says she cannot see this price in their database. I am literally refreshing the page as I speak to the agent and am seeing $843. I had to send a screenshot of what I am seeing on their website to them to prove that I am seeing this price!! She then says that because the flight is book, she cannot refund the difference but can provide it as a credit due to their price drop protection. I was not satisfied with this but looked like I didn’t have another option so I agree and she tells me that it will appear in my account within 3-5 business days. It has been 4 and still nothing but we will see. During the call, I ask to speak with a supervisor and she tells me that the supervisor will basically tell me the same thing… The total time for this call was 1 hour. Then I finally see the charge on my credit card - I see 2 charges. One with the description AIR CANADA totalling $843 and another with description TASF totalling $53. I google TASF and find out this mean travel agent service fee. I am so furious now as they never informed me that this was part of the price they quoted to me!! It is not even detailed in the invoice. I tried calling and the agent tells me that this doesn’t need to be detailed to me, it is part of the total price but I am still not convinced. This is only $53 but the principle of the matter, I was not informed of the details of the charges to my credit card, let alone the absolutely horrible service, I am sure this is in violation of some consumer protection act or travel agents act. Overall absolutely terrible terrible nightmarish experience with FlightNetwork. Not worth the headache and lack of transparency. Embarrassing that this is a Canadian company.\n",

We booked extra legroom seats and we felt the cost was worth it. Seat Selection: This was done online as well and it was simple. My only complaint is that we wanted two aisle seats and it wouldn't let me. Online Check in: I checked in a week ahead of time and printed boarding passes. Again, simple and easy. Night before luggage drop: We dropped off our luggage the night before with no stress or problems. I love being able to do this. Flight: Boarding was on time and very efficient. We did take off about 20 minutes later than planned. The flight was comfortable. We had bought a Boots Meal deal at the airport before we went to the plan. So, we did not purchase anything on the plane. We booked extra space seats and they were good value for my tall husband. The flight is about 3 hours from Manchester. Luggage & Immigration in Naples: we disembarked quickly upon landing to a bus. At immigration, the lines went quickly. We had a little wait for the luggage and then off to our transfer. From landing to our transport heading to Sorrento, it took about 1 1/2 hours. The return trip was just as simple and easy. We were pleased with our flights and now look forward to our trip on the Dreamliner this summer.\n",

Although I certainly understand Boise (or as I call it, Spudville!) is NOT a travel hub of any sort, it just shouldn't be this complicated to buy a ticket online, without involving a travel agent! In looking at Korean Air, Cathay Pacific, etc--one cannot \"start\" from Boise, even though they are partners with airlines that do fly into Boise. I really don't want to travel on two separate tickets. I have also tried Matrix--which is usually very helpful in finding a good \"routing\" and price from Spudville. In the past I've found my itinerary, then just gone to the airline website to purchase the ticket. Worked like a charm for last two trips to Europe! With Bangkok, this isn't working--the fares are MUCH higher on the airlines websites than Matrix, and I can't enter Boise as a starting point. I'm looking at traveling mid January 2012 for about 4 weeks. Flying into and out of BKK is fine. Any suggestions or help is much appreciated! Thanks!\n",

We signed up for trip alerts and didn't receive any but one that said they were ontime. Instead they were 4 hours late leaving Toronto and did not notify or communicate this to anyone until 15 minutes before when we were supposed to board. They made us wait for over an hour for a voucher for Lunch and then we got $5, which doesn't buy much more than a coffee at Pearson International. We paid for Premium seats because we had heard the seats were tight and then ours seats were double booked. We were worried about lost bags and went with carry on. When we arrived there were people that had lost luggage, I felt especiaily sad for this young teenage girl who was in tears on the bus ride to the resort. Coming home was no better. Web check in wasn't even offered on the way back Delays again coming home and the sign at the gate continued to read on time, even though they were not. They forced us to check our bags or pay several hundred dollars to carry them on even though we had less then when we went down and the bags were standard carry size for any other airline. We arrived so late that we had to pay for a hotel stay at the airport when we got back. On the 7.5 hour flight down we had one drink service that happened 3.5 hours after we boarded.

My wife and I just returned from a round trip via Delta from Charlotte to Jacksonville, FL. We flew first class cheaper than a coach seat on AA. From the moment we stepped up to the ticket counter in Charlotte until we got our baggage back at the end of the trip, it was amazing to experience the difference in service. The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing. Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat, fresh blankets, pillows, and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground, and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles. Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings. The entire crew was dressed very sharply, smiled, and actually thanked us for flying with them. They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service. Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crews....it is common place on AA. It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable. On each leg of the trip, our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim. AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutes. Best decision we've made to switch our business to Delta.\n",

The inflight service on the flight from JFK (772-200LR) was pleasant and seats were comfortable and were flat for sleeping. The airline's grounds services at JFK is not efficient for a large group. There were no Pre-Boarding areas for Executive or Business classes at the gate. The ground servive at BLR was also very inefficient and transit service at BOM was HORRIBLE. The flight from BOM to EWR on 747 was acceptable with good inflight food service, but non-existent entertainment and the seats were not flat. The transit at Heathrow (a refueling and more passengers stop) was the most miserable experience in all our flying years....We would not recommend to anyone flying through Heathrow as transit passengers. Their security staff is rude and there is no concept of organized boarding at Heathrow. Incidentally, there is barely enough time to exit the plane with all your belongings, go through security and make it back to the gate before the plane is supposed to leave.

We would miss our connection to Cairo so they re-booked us on Egypt Air (much better airline than Turkish Air!!!!!) On our return flight, which we bought tickets for (and paid for and reserved seat assignments, frequent flyers miles numbers, special meals), we discovered Turkish Air re-sold our seats and I guess cancelled the reservation. The result was the absolute worst seats in the back of the plane, not sitting together as a family even though we were travelling with a child. Also, we apparently don't get frequent flyer partner miles with this airline either, even though the Turkish Air agent on the phone and the ones in the airport assured us we would. We will never fly Turkish Air again and will never use Expedia either. If you want to go to Egypt, use Egyptair. Much better everything---customer service, flight attendants, food, AND they are on time or actually leave early if everyone is checked in! Never, ever fly Turkish Air. Terrible\n",

The problem is that I've asked this question 3 times with 3 different telephone reps at Travel Guard Insurance and I've gotten 3 different answers. I don't think the telephone reps understand this either. My question is this: When buying the policy, you have to put down on the application \"trip cost.\" Using BA Avios points for a Business Class ticket, the taxes and fees which I paid were about $1100. (OUCH !!!) The first agent told me to insure the cost of the actual ticket. (I knew this wasn't correct so I called back.) The second agent told me I could only list the cost to re-deposit the points in case of cancellation. This would be $65 USD. I wanted to double-check, so I called back a 3rd time, and the 3rd agent told me to put down the cost of the taxes and fees. In case of cancellation, I would get the taxes and fees back from BA.

We've never used travel insurance because except on one occasion we've always booked our own flights, hotels, trains, etc. That said - I've noticed a number of posts on this and other boards gently chiding people who've encountered problems in their travels for not purchasing trip insurance policies.

Essentially the *same* thing happened on the return flight... except this time they said they had absolutely no record of her ticket and forced us to buy another one. Naturally, customer service at Volaris is a joke in English or Spanish. In Spanish, they'll talk down to you, tell you it was your fault, and stonewall you. They'll refuse to let you speak to a supervisor. In English, they'll sound very nice and helpful and then do nothing, saying they'll call you back after checking with the airport for more details. Surprise, surprise, they never call back. If you then call them back, the supervisor (if you're lucky enough to get one... usually the reps just refuse to connect you) will not take your call, leaving you on hold for hours. If you hang up and work your way through Customer Service to the same supervisor... he'll tell his reps to tell you \"he'll call you right back.\" Two months later, and many, many hours on the phone, still no refund. Next stop PROFECO? Anyone else have this problem? What's the next move (besides obviously never flying with them again and advising everyone I know to do the same)?\n",

      "Hi, has anyone had any problems with HMPO online form when submiting their passport application? I applied for my first adult passport in July/2014 by using the online form available. Approximately six weeks later I received a letter saying I needed to complete a whole new form, this time in paper form. I contacted HMPO and asked why, since my application was complete and with no errors. They told me it was because I had missed Section 4 (details on parents). I went back into the online form, this time taking screen shots with date and time, and surprise, surprise there was no Section 4 in the online version of the form. I was never given the opportunity to write my parents details. I repeated the process several times in different dates and managed to get to the end of the form (screen to complete payment and submit). I tried contacting them by phone, but they insisted that despite the problem I had to go through the whole process again. I tried complaining, had no replies. Phoned again several times, then they finally said they could not find my application, then later on they \"found\" it but that there was no way around it. As a result I have waited for my passport to be processed for more than 8 weeks now - and still no idea when it will be finalised. I read in a similar trip advisor forum (\"Problems with the Passport Office,dated April 2014) that some people, Miss B and Nanny503927 for example, were having similar problems. I would not recommend use of HMPO online form for new applicants... And i was wondering if anyone has had similar issues. Thank you\n",

I booked some flights and elected to pay by Direct Deposit to avoid the credit card surcharge. As my bank is the same as theirs the transaction was processed immediately. Two working days later when I checked my itinerary, it was flagged as pending, unpaid. As when I had originally made the payment it said that the booking would only be held for two days I was a little concerned and phoned their customer service department. When I eventually got through, after some discussion I was asked to send a copy of my bank's confirmation of payment, which I duly did. Later that day I found the itinerary was now marked as paid so I was happy enough with that. However, this morning a Jetstar rep called me to check that everything was now OK and ask if I had received my itinerary (which I had). Not only that, but she had to call four times before I was available to take the call, which I thought was pretty good follow up, I would have thought they'd give up after the second try. They did leave voice mail, but only to say they wanted to speak with me personally, so they also didn't take that out and call it good. I was impressed, better service than I expected.\n",

      "I have not flown internationally in a long time....or even domestically since the invention of the TSA. I therefore had some trepidation about the flight, figuring it would be a royal PITA, no food, and generally where the end would justify the means. Wrong. I chose British Airways Open Skies from Newark to Orly because I had always had good experiences with BA. Also, I liked the idea of a smaller plane with less people. It seemed to be a bit more civilized. I was not disappointed even though we traveled economy. The seats were leather and comfy, and not quite as narrow as some. Our seats were the first row in economy, so although not separated by a wall, there was a lot of leg space between our seats and the last row of business class. We were not treated as if we were the inferior class. We received iPads, a full meal which was quite good, as well as a small breakfast snack before landing...all at no additional cost. Upon the return we were two in three seats, which was terrific. We had a sizable snack, a full meal which was also quite good and another snack prior to landing. The flight crew (captain et al) on both flights were terrific....informative and very personable. The flight attendants were very pleasant, professional and helpful...and love the uniforms as they have a chic retro vibe. Along with the pillow and blanket we received a packet with eye shades, socks, and another item I can't recall. Boarding and disembarking were both a breeze although upon Orly arrival we did not have jetway access but had to disembark on the airfield where a bus waited to take us to the terminal. On the return to Newark we hit a wind shear upon touch down which the female pilot handled very admirably. Luggage retrieval was painless...again, due to far fewer passengers. One point...the 757-200 is a narrow body jet. Therefore the aisles are narrower than many other types of aircraft. Therefore, any bump in the air will cause you to bump the passenger in the seat if walking in the aisle, or be bumped if you are seated. Other than that, the flight was like flying used to be, when passengers were treated like humans, and not cattle. IMO, all,others airlines should,take a page out of the BAOS book. I would fly them again in a heartbeat. Now all they need to add is in flight WiFi, and the service would be perfect.\n",

I want to make sure you know I'm not one of those people. When booking my trip I did request assistance from Allegiant with my luggage, moving through the airport and security, to the gate, and on and off the plane. I tried to be as specific as possible as to the assistance I needed since I was traveling alone. These requests were not out of line and should have all been provided by Allegiant. Instead, Allegiant asked my family member who was dropping me off at the airport to help me to my gate which was a huge inconvieniece for them. On my first leg the gate was changed before the flight and another passenger had to move me to the new gate. But that was nothing compared to how I found my wheelchair every time I received it back from Allegiant after landing. After the first leg, the left arm rest was broken off. I didn't say anything at that time thinking that it was just a \"things happen\" situation. I really lost it though when at the end of my second leg, as I was being wheeled down the ramp, the young man who was wheeling me down wheeled my left wheel partially on the edge of the ramp causing the rubber tire to come off my wheel!! Then he started telling me how it was \"normal wear and tear\". REALLY?!?! When my husband and I got back to our car we inspected the chair closer and found that the edge of the back of the chair had a rip in the vinyl!! It's going to cost me more to repair this chair than it will to just replace it. What makes me so angry is that no one says sorry. My husband worked for an entire day to make this chair fit my personality by painting it sparkly hot pink since I have to spend so much time in it. Now though, I'm house bound because they just didn't care to take care of something that is so important to me. I did contact them, I guess they have 30 days to respond.\n",

When I checked in at Melbourne Airport I had the misfortune to be quite ill with flu and on top of not feeling well I had problems with my ticket. Instead of being helpful and sympathetic the Australian staff working behind the counters sent me away 4 times to different counters to try and sort out my problem which took over an 1 1/2 hours. Once on board the plane I was put next to a small baby and on asking the cabin crew if I could be moved as I did not want to give the child my germs, I was rudely told that there was nothing they could do for me. All in all my flight from the moment of check in to when I landed was an absolute nightmare. Have other passengers had the bad luck of dealing with rude and unhelpful Qatar Airways staff?\n",

      "I`ll always remember when we went to China back in 2008, the weather in August was too hot for me but the country was fascinating and the Eclipse was fantastic : aerialsandtv.com/…ChinaEclipse Unfortunately BOTH our suitcase failed on the same trip ! And, significantly, the zips went on both of them. So we needed new cases, we wanted strong hard shell weatherproof ones (having seen what happens to soft cases left out in the rain......) and, most importantly, no zips. And we found them ! American Tourister \"Flite\" (Samsonite`s budget range). They`re not the lightest in the world but built like tanks, plastic tanks I grant you, but tanks none the less. You`ll always see loads of them owned by seasoned travellers on airport luggage carousels. They came with a 3 year guarantee, but 4 years later after loads of hard use we needed a spare part for one, it just screwed on and they just put it in the post, for free ! That level of customer service is rare indeed these days. Anyway, earlier this year a friend of mine wanted my advice on what suitcase to buy. I`ve seldom been so certain of any recommendation, buy the American Tourister hard shell suitcases we bought back in 2009, but guess what ? Yes you`re right ! They don`t do them anymore ! In fact they don`t do anything similar and neither does anyone else (well Samsonite do one model, but that was a bit out of her price range). The question is why are all suitcases on the market these days flimsy soft and zipped ? ! ? Edited: 4:15 pm, September 20, 2012\n",

Prior to take off in Perth we were joined in the row in front of us by 3 drunk men who from that moment on set about drinking the cabin dry. After an hour, the one in front of my wife suddenly decided to put his seat into a full recline position hitting my wife in the face. We complained and verbal hostilities arose. We were moved 5 rows back. This was not the end of our troubles. From that point onwards we were threatened contiunally by these men. This was pointed out to the crew. Approaching to land I was told by \"the leader\" that they would be waiting for me in the corridor. This was heard by a Stewardess. A terrifying experience all round. Nothing happened in the corridor but we were on edge continually. Luckily for us, they did not continue on our joining flight to Heathrow. I emailed a complaint to Malaysia Airways and 4 weeks later they have replied sending a 3 line email back saying thanks for my observations and they will review their practices on future flights. The questions is. Do I now leave it at that or is that the best I can expect from a 5 star airline ?????\n",

They are always packed with too few staff (counters & \"TSA\" checkpoints), the flights NEVER take off on time, you can't understand the PA system and a Coke costs 6 Euros. And, I have a problem every time I use Alitalia. They are famous for switching your seats if they have an Alitalia frequent flyer book after you who asks for your seats. They always give first priority to their own frequent flyers. It's happened to me three times now (most recently 9/14), so they still do it. You can go ahead book through Delta, but make sure that it's a Delta flight on Delta equipment. Otherwise, you're taking your chances.

      "First of all - let me say - I know baggage allowances exist for good reason - and that we should abide by them - This post is not about that - its about how in certain situations staff really make it hard for customers to like a brand. I was flying Ork-Birmigham on an ATR72 (double prop plane with limited overhead baggage space). I fly this route relatively often - and as often as not hand luggage is take from you and put in the hold. Also - as often as not this plane runs at least 30 minutes late. So I arrive in Cork and would prefer not to have to have bags checked - but they are as its a pretty full flight. C'est la Vie. The flight leaves late due to late inbound craft -(which is a BS excuse really - - a more honest one would be the craft was late because its on an end to end schedule with very tight turnaround times, and we stuffed up somewhere earlier in the day) So I land an hour late and then have to wait for my bags - C'est la vie. On my return leg - I decide to ask at check in should I check my bag - I get advised that if I do there will be a charge (at least 50% of the time that i fly this route I am forced to check it - which of course is free - but I prefer not having to check it). I inform the staff member (Ms Ragdish) that i have no desire to check it, but will it be taken off me. She asks me to present it for weighing - and as it weighs 11KG she says I must pay 40£ to check it. I offered to take something out but she stated that then my laptop case would be over weight. So I had to pay 40£ to have a suitcase taken off me that would have been taken off me anyway. I only offered as having flown the route many times I wanted to assist on making things run smoother. And this was how I was repayed What a lousy customer loyalty reward. Then the PLane ran 75 minutes late. Michael O'Leary from Ryan Air decided a year and a half ago that it wasnt a good idea to muck about as much on luggage restrictions - and moved away from it in favour of better customer services. Aer lingus have apparently decided to try and see if they can make that failed policy work. Can I ask the question of Aer Lingus - If you try to emulate his failed baggage policy, could I implore you to try and at least aim for his successful on time policy? (soap box dismantled)\n",

      "This is not an airline I thought I would ever use. However, I booked a short break and only at the end of the booking did the lady mention it was a Ryanair flight. (Thanks to those of you on this forum that pointed out Ryanair don’t actually permit this; thankfully we were fine). I spent forever obsessing about my hand luggage and in the end opted to take only a rucksack – was only staying 3 nights. As soon as I arrived at the airport I headed straight to their bag measurers to ensure it was the right size. Turns out it could have been double the size and it would still have been okay. However, I needn’t have bothered because no one checked the size or weight of the bag before boarding either of the flights. In fact, as far as I could see no one on either of our flights had their bags checked. I did wonder though if this was because of flight was running late because as we were queuing to board we could see people departing the plane. Funnily enough we taxied right on time and for the return flight we left about 10 minutes late. I spent ages entering the online check in details as there’s a charge for entering information incorrectly. Again, I needn’t have bothered as the guy barely glanced my passport as he tore my boarding pass. When we did get onboard there did seem to be a problem with some people’s luggage as there wasn’t room overhead for everything but they managed to squeeze cases under some people’s seat. The plane seemed clean as far as I could see and the seats were comfy. Only criticism was that the seats did not recline nor were there any pockets on the back of the seat in front of you to store newspapers etc. I didn’t purchase any drinks or snacks as I took my own on board. And the little interaction I had with staff was pleasant enough. Another slightly annoying things was that my mum, who travels on a Barbados passport, had to have her boarding pass stamped before departure or she’s refused boarding. They make this very clear for the departure flight but I didn’t think it was necessary for the return flight. Praise God I decided to check to be on the safe side because it turns out it needs to be stamped in both directions. So, the nightmares I had in the lead up to the flight were unfounded. However, there was a couple at our hotel who flew out on another Ryanair flight and were charged the £40 for being a kilo over weight. To me it begged the question of whether there was something they could have thrown away and purchased once they landed but hey. Would I fly Ryanair again? Probably not of my choosing but if I absolutely had to then I guess I would as long as I was careful to follow all their rules.\n",

      "Just wanted to relieve some of the anxiety for those of you who have booked flights with Globespan and heard the horror stories. I was very apprehensive and expecting some delays, but everything was fine. We flew out of the Hamilton, Ontario, terminal and it was great! So compact, no walking, just park the car, walk in, check in, and on the plane. Wonderful compared to Pearson. Arrived in Dublin, Ireland on time. Flight over was in an older aircraft purchased from an Icelandic airline. We bought economy no frills and it was pretty tight for leg room. If you have long legs, spring for the premier. Other than that, it was just fine - plane left and arrived on time. On the flight home, we got a \"free\" meal and non alcoholic drinks, even though it said on the website you needed to preorder the meals. The people that preordered got a different meal (beef or pasta dish). We got a type of chili with vegetables and a bun with a dessert. Can't say every flight will go as smoothly, but I hope this will help with some of the apprehension involved with this airline.\n",

      "Feb 2nd, 2008 I was at Newark/Liberty airport to pick up a puppy that was being sent to me from a breeder in Texas. Unfortunately this breeder used American Airlines to transport the dog. I had used the useless flight tracker to get updated on the status of flight 558 and tracked the \"Airway Bill/Confirmation number\" to track as well. I called American Airlines Cargo prior to going to the airport. The flight was scheduled to arrive early and I took my family to the airport to pick up our new dog. After waiting for well over two hours after the flight landed, the people representing American Airlines Cargo could not give any information other than \"we don't know where the dog is, there were no dogs on flight 558\". They offered NO direction or help other than asking people to leave the carge office. In fact all four people behind the counter disappeared into a side \"break room\" with a poor attitude and suggessted we call in a few hours to see if the \"packages\" were found. Disgraceful. There were 11 families waiting and as this dragged on with absolutely no communication there was obviously frustration. The solution for the American Airlines employees was to call the airport security. These were families with children waiting and this was an absurd way to handle the situation. I called the breeder who could not get any information. I called American Airlines twice from my cell phone, only to be told that the dog in fact was at Newark airport as the flight had landed with the dog was on it. Not true but this was the only information available. Clearly no one knew what was going on and there is a serious flaw in their tracking capabilities. The fact that an error was made was not the issue. The complete inability of anyone representing AA at the airport or on the phone to address the situation was beyond irresponsible. The people in the cargo office were rude, unprofessional and dismissive. In fact, as we waited there were people from other flights coming to claim pets that were also lost because American Airlines never bothered to put them on the flight. AA systems are dangerously flawed. The employees are incompetenent, don't care and the airline is incapable of being trusted to transport an animal, child or anything of value. These puppies and family pets were left unattended in small crates for an unhealthy amount of time, neglected by American Airlines. They truly think of animals as nothing more than cargo and have zero concern for the health and well being of any animal they are transporting. If they can not responsibly transport a dog, YOU are not safe on this Airline. They have obviously stopped caring at all and should do us all a favor by declaring bancruptcy and get out of a business that has clearly passed them by.\n",

I phoned last Friday and they confirmed the 23 kilos was right, I phoned yesterday and they said it was 20 kilos and the lady had to look on line to find out what I ment, then she came back to me and said that the 23kilos was a mistake and they would only allow up to 20 kilos. When the sale went through and the e mail was sent out they say one thing and as soon as you confirm they move the goal post. I told them that it obviously not a mistake but a deliberate change of their mind. As our flight going out is still with GB and now coming back with Easyjet with 2 different allowances which is really annoying, as they also informed me that one case cannot be 22 kilos and another 18 which is even more annoying. I have printed off the website answer to the question which says that GB passengers will not have their baggage allowance changed, do you think I have a leg to stand on if I take this to the airport.

      "The topic of airfare price drops has been done to death I guess but I'll give it another whack. Is Air Canada the worst offender? I am not an experienced air traveller but I was very surprised to find the airfare for the same flights I booked in early February from Australia to Vancouver return (Sep/Oct travel) have dropped by 25% six weeks later! I booked the cheapest fare (economy tango) for my family on our first international trip and I chose Air Canada because it is a direct flight and we have limited time during school holidays. The airlines seem to know when it is holiday time and bump up the prices. I have to say 25% is a significant price drop for the same class seats on the same flights. I am disappointed at losing $2000 and it is an unfortunate lesson. If I could afford the higher fares I gather the tickets would be refundable and I would not lose out, except for the nasty cancellation fee. My tickets are not refundable and I am informed there is no option to rebook at the new lower fare. I wouldn't mind so much if the price drop wasn't so large. If this is a normal occurrence it seems booking with Air Canada is like spending money on a lottery ticket.\n",

      "My family and I booked 4 tickets to New York for a week long stay, a week cruise, and then reurn home. Given that the day the ship returns to port, we will also have to fly back home, I called British Airways and asked in the slim possibility that Internet will not be avaialble on board the ship (distance, technical problems etc) what can be done if anything to ensure that all 4 family members can be together for the long flight back home. It is a very remote possibility that Internet will not be available on board the ship, but who knows.... I just wanted to make sure that we do not have any unplesant surprises. To my dismay they said that airport check-in is possible but do not guarantee that we will all be seated together. They asked for a total of 200EUR to preallocate the seats. I would expect this from a low-cost budget airline but certainly not from BA. I did not ask for a ticket change or any other upgrade or service (like extra luggage or preferential seating) I should pay for, but paying 5000EUR for 4 tickets and then being asked for another 200EUR for the simplest of service, it really bothers me. In my opinion this is a \"nickel and dime\" practice at best. I wrote them an email about it, and they did NOT even respond to it. I would at least expect a typical answer from them. Are my expectations unreasonable (do not overcharge for services, replay to complaint emails)???? Thank you all, Andreas\n",

I'll try to keep this brief. Phx-PHL leg uneventful. Got to PHL and checked in at gate and big problem. They had to downsize the aircraft from a 767 to a 757 and were asking volunteers to give up seats. I had a HUGE event plannd in London next night I could not give my seat up. Finally they had enough volunteers and they tried to split me and my freind up. I said no way she is elderly and can barely walk and needs assistance with everything so they put us back together. Got to LHR safely. Had great trip. Flight back..huge overbook and again asking for volunteers, at least no aircraft downgrade. Left almost on time, not 1 seat to spare. Got to PHL and sat on runway for almost an hour no open gates. I had to reclaim my bag, go through security again, ran with my carryon and laptop to the gate and missed the jet by 5 minutes. I had to stay the night without any of my bags they had already been checked. No clean clothes, nothing. All toiletries sitting in Phx. Got small care package from airline with toothbrush, shampoo thats it. Cell phone dead because charger in suitcase.

      "Leaving in 3 weeks for a 14 day cruise with 3 day extensions before and after cruise--so about 3 weeks total. Flying from San Diego (commuter plane) to LAX where we fly British Air to Heathrow and then into Stockholm. Hope to pack in just carry on, not because we don't want to pay for luggage, but because on our last trip, through Heathrow, British Air lost our checked bag(s) in BOTH directions. The carry on suitcase, that I have used successfully in the past, is the 22\" from Costco with 2 wheels only. I did carry it on a year and a half ago on British Air without any problem. Also, it did fit into the sizing frame on an American Air domestic flight this past May, when the LAX porter said \"that bag is too big for a carry on!\" but I am concerned about whether British Air has a new size restriction for carry on bags. The bag measures 23\" from wheels to top, even though it is sold as a 22\". If we are going to have to check this bag after arrival at the airport, I might as well pack in a large bag and not have to worry about what I pack. What are your thoughts?\n",

When they asked us for our passenger information we provided them with the correct information regarding first and last names. However, when they sent our itinerary, my first name was misspelled. I usually write my name as 'Luuk', while my passport says 'Lucas'. I remember signing emails with Luuk, yet I also know that I gave the correct passport names when asked. When I was at Heathrow airport I first encountered that the name on my ticket didnt match my passport. At that point it wasn't to big a deal, but I got to fly anyway. I tried to change my name at the AIR New Zealand service desk, but they couldnt do it and said that the travel agent had to do it. I'm currently in Australia after stopping over in Hong Kong. I could make all flights with the wrong name, even if that sometimes led to skewed faces. I've contacted the travel agent (Travel Nation) and asked them if they could change my name, since I provided them with the correct names. They told me it couldnt be done, since I already started travelling. Instead the added a note, stating that my first name was misspelled. In the accompanying email (in which my first name was misspelled again as Luuc!!!!!) they stated that 'this is not a guarantee for the USA'. So now I'm getting a bit freaked. I'm sure that I will be able to fly to all my other destinations, but If I cant fly to the US, that would be awfull. Is there nothing that can be done?\n",

I have read reviews where members seem to have a pompous attitude to dress code and snub any form of casual sports wear. My son looks very respectable in his fashion wear and is clean and tidy. I have worked in office environments where business men dressed in suits are offensive due to their uncleanliness but because it is a suit and looks business it is deemed. Dress code is surely subjective for an airport lounge where people are meant to be in holiday mode! Shouldn't the fact that a person is be clean and tidy and respectful be more important than what line of attire they are wearing? I totally agree that a person should dress respectful in terms of not revealing too much flesh but reasonable length shorts and trainers...what is the problem? Maybe there should be a business lounge purely for business attire and an exclusive lounge for respectful people who can wear any fashion provided they are clean, tidy and respectful to others.\n",

      "Just want to give others a heads up that Cheap Caribbean/Apple Group is a company with horrible business practices as well as customer support. Be very aware that when you click on accepting the terms of use this company will not compensate you for any errors they have made. Our experience is a result of this company not disclosing on their website they charge in US currency. However, looking through various sites even US based clients have had several issues regarding this company not providing compensation for legitimate complaints. I have sent the following email to the founder of Apple Leisure and the CEO and they refuse to respond. You will also notice the contact info for this company is very vague on their website. In short, we have booked vacations through many on-line companies that are ethical. THis one is not so do not expect any client support from them..... I am writing today to tell you how disappointed I am in your misleading business practices and disgusted I am with your customer support (a common thread in many reviews for your company). I shop on-line a lot and book trips through on-line travel sites so I am knowledgeable on how things work at check-out. I am from Canada and shop in the US, UK and, of course, Canada. We used Cheap Caribbean last year to book a trip and we were charged Canadian funds (funds were at par) and because of this we assumed your company charges us in our currency. There is NOTHING on the website or at checkout to indicate otherwise. For example, even when we book with Hotwire US we are quoted at checkout USD meaning the final price states clearly USD. Cheap Caribbean does not specify anywhere on the website or on our ticket voucher you charge in USD. There is nothing in your contract either to indicate you charge in USD. We were pretty shocked when we were billed $450+ more than we were invoiced for on our credit card. When I called customer care indicating I expect a refund the differance I was informed by a robotic like human ...we are a US company we charge in USD. I could not get Bobby to understand the issue is not that you charge in USD, you don't tell your customers you charge USD. A call to the supervisor was a waste of time. He could care less. The LAST think a customer wants to here is \"we are not doing anything for you\". So, as a result of this I have filed a complaint with the BBB and had several conversations with my friends and coworkers telling them how misleading this company is and all I spoke to are shocked you do not indicate what currency you charge in. Your refusal to pay back what you should not have charged in the first place will cost you a lot of future business. Your lack of action speaks volumes about your business practices (shady) and you lack of interest in customer satisfaction. Also, you may want to have a supervisor train your service reps.

Passengers may only carry small quantities (max. 100 ml per container) of liquids, gels and aerosols in their hand baggage. The packaging of these products must also meet specific requirements. This applies for all passengers departing from or catching connecting flights at airports within the European Union. The new rules apply for liquids such as water and other drinks, but also extend to gels, pastes, lotions, and the contents of aerosols. This includes toiletries such as toothpaste, shaving cream, hair gel, lip gloss, facial creams, mascara and liquid lip balms. These are the rules for liquids in your hand luggage: You can only bring on liquids and gels in containers of no more than 100 millilitres. These containers must be carried in a transparent plastic bag. There is a limit of one transparent plastic bag per person. The volume of the transparent plastic bag may not be greater than 1 litre.

      "Just got back from NY. What a wonderful airline. Super quick check in and lounge at Luton. Seats extremely comfortable, with many positions + massage facility. Free drinks and good food with extremely pleasant staff. I can't fault this airline for value for money!! I understand they are having a new lounge and check in at Newark in the near future. We had to spend 7 hours there on our way back and as there is no left baggage facility at the airport and the Silverjet lounge didn't open until midday we couldn't get in to NY for the day which was our intention. However, that is hardly Silverjet's fault and as I understand they are shortly starting another flight to NY presumably the check in will be open for more hours. Anyway the lounge was perfectly comfortable, with plenty of food and drinks should one need it. All in all a great experience and we shall certainly never travel to NY any other way.\n",

      "Beware what you get with budget airlines ... you probably will get what you pay for --- or in my case less. Flew Spirit Airlines from New York to Myrtle Beach and back last week with my wife and two-year old. Of course with kids (especially with safety seats that have to be in window seat to prevent blocking the egress path) I knew we'd be ponying up a significant chunk of change for baggage charges and pre-paid seat assignments. Flights were delayed, lines were long, ground staff was overworked and, with exception of one nice man, rude ... but figured you get what you pay for. Little did I know, you can actually get less than you paid for --- on the return flight the Spirit Airlines computer system was down in Myrtle Beach --- causing in addition to very long lines (always fun with a 2-year old), the loss of all information on who pre-paid for seats and baggage so it would be open seating. Annoying, but we were informed that all baggage would be free and anyone pre-paying for baggage or seat assignments would get a refund by calling the 1-800 number. Other than asking twice for the 1-800 number and never getting it, we did arrive safely in NY two hours late which is not horrible for LaGuardia. However, upon returning and calling the 1-800 number I was informed that since I did check luggage and did use 3 seats - I would not have any money refunded. So you can get less that what you paid for --- even on a budget airline.\n",

Obviously you don't expect or get full service on a short island hop, but it's quite adequate. There may be something in the WI culture (or LIAT training) which doesn't generate an instant but synthetic 'have a nice day' welcome but, if you engage with the staff, my experience was that you receive a warm & informed response.

      "Hi, I'm wondering if it is possible to change the 'return' round trip flights to another departure location?... I originally bought the round trip tickets: \"Toronto->China\" and \"China->Toronto\". In between I'm also planning on going to other nearby countries(Hongkong, Taiwan, Japan). I haven't bought other tickets yet, including the last flight from \"Japan->China\" (the one I'm trying to avoid buying right now) The reason that I bought the roundtrip instead of one way was because originally I was planning on going back to China again after my trips for couple weeks then return to Toronto. But right now something came up and I will have to return early... Basically, I'm asking if there's a way to change my return roundtrip flight from \"china->toronto\" to \"japan->toronto\"? so I won't have to buy another ticket from japan to china just to get on the return flight. :( Please let me know what would be the best option for me.

      "Flying to Orlando from Manchester I booked 2 exit seats to get the extra leg room - row 49, seats J+K. 49 H+J had acres of leg room, but 49K had virtually no leg room! The reason is that the exit door has a huge box in front of it, presumably to store the slide to be used in an emergency. Since this is right in front of seat 49K, there is almost no leg room - it is worse than the normal seats! I complained to the steward, who said that there was nothing he could do but to log it as an incident. Fortunately for us, there was no-one sitting in seat 49H so we used H+J and had a great flight - but it could have been much worse.

      "Flew yesterday from Manchester to Orlando. Routing was originally via Atlanta with 4 hour layover prior to onward to MCO. 10 pax with reserved seating in economy. All pretty routine. Half of party arrives at MAN and calls me as checking out hotel, Atlanta flight overbooked. Heart sinks as travelling first time where it is just me with three sons, and sons girlfriend. So as I am mentally thinking EU261 rules, this is quickly followed up by they want to know if we are willing to switch to non stop flight leaving 30 minutes later. Heck yes, especially with a PE upgrade thrown in. 747-400 (Barbarella): great IFE, pretty good food (chicken well spicy must have read the tomato juice experiment), excellent attentive service. Seat are good pitch, but for me are not the most comfortable with headrest adjustment poor. Economy on way home is going too be a let down for the kids, hey ho. MCO arrival was excellent. We were an hour from wheels down to driving out the rental car garage. Immigration was empty, used new kiosks which worked for 7 out of 10 including sons girlfriend who had not travelled before. We did go through recheck for 3 as their receipts had a cross on. I know some have reported this process being done twice over, with some work to rule type approach but for me it was only for issues with taking finger scan. Grabbed bags, hit the tram and out. So great experience all round, even saw the Dreamliner at MAN ;-) Now just need to ask an EU261 compensation questions and complain about not getting my assigned seats...\n",

They offered me £30 compensation, it cost me £220 in phone bills trying to get someone to look for them. They actually make money from putting you on hold. I found several auction houses in London that sell off \"lost luggage\" and kept doing a search for records. 4 months later, guess what, they were selling off my records that they claim they could not find. On calling up the auction house, they read out a few titles and that confirmed that they were my records. No they were NOT my records they belonged to BA and there was nothing I could do but bid on them again in the hope that I would win back my own records. The ladies in the auction house were very helpful and I did win back my records for £60. 1.2 million bags were \"irretrievably lost\" by BA in 2007. Shocking really.\n",

When I look it up on Delta's website, it says from the US to Europe you get 1 free checked bag. delta.com/content/… We did actually check 2 bags for one of us and one for the other and were not charged. The people next to us in the bag drop were also checking 2 bags per person. We did pay for Economy Comfort, but that doesn't seem to affect what bags you can check. The only logical reason I can see would be if the UK is not considered part of Europe and falls into the \"For all other international flights\" at the bottom of the chart.

      "My boyfriend and I made a trip to Spain(Hong Kong-Madrid and Madrid- Hong Kong). We flied with Aeroflot and had both trips scaling in Moscow. Both going(30th Aug) and coming back(15th Sep), the luggages were spot checked as the suitcase locks were open when we got the luggages back (which we think by Russia Airport Authority as this has never happened since I have transited and been traveling around to any other countries). The going trip to Spain, both suitcase locks were open, broken lock for my boyfriend's case which he bought a new suitcase in Spain later. However, the real disaster was actually the coming back trip!! When we picked up the luggage, we found out that both luggages were broken, there are also 2 breakage spots on my luggage itself, the luggage handle came off and the locks were totally forced broken(so my boyfriend lost totally 2 suitcases for this trip). I have locked them before check-in and my suitcase is the type that came with international lock that can be opened by international key in case the luggage would be spot checked by any airport authority so it should not be forced open in such manner! That aside, when we got home, I opened the luggage just to find out that the things inside were totally flipped over in a big mess! The zipped compartment inside was open and the clothes are all messed up(as messy as a 80% sale basket in the shopping mall), the wrapped present was torn open, wrapping paper and the pieces of present scattered around everywhere in the luggage. Furthermore, my boyfriend's mobile phone(old one with problem which we was thinking to get it fixed in China) and his suit (together with necktie and belt) were stolen! The box of mobile phone was left behind together with the torn open plastic suit bag but both of the items were no where to be found! I tried to call the airline but nobody picked up, now I'm waiting for the reply email which I don't know whether they will even cared to read. Frankly speaking, I have no hope that they will contact us back. So this post is only an example and a warning for you guys to be careful and choose the airline wisely (we bought it because it was the cheapest flight ticket, an obviously resulted as an expensive lesson). For us, this is the first and will be the last time we will ever fly with Aeroflot or transit via Russia. With what had happened, we would not hesitate to pay 100-200 EUR more to get a better flight that transit elsewhere!!!\n",

      "End of March 2012 I made a trip to Manaus, Brazil. It was my first experience with \"long distance travelling\". The flight was booked and payed trough Ebookers.be. The flight itself was made by TAP Portugal. The journey to Manaus was perfect, but on my return happened an unexpected problem. Checking in at Manaus airport for the flight Manaus to Fortaleza, flight made by the Brazilian company GOL, they refused to let me check in. My seat was reserved, but, it seemed that the ticket was not payed by TAP. Even showing my e-ticket and proof of my payment, they refused to let me board. It was at that moment not possible to contact TAP in Brazil or Ebookers. The only way to take that flight was to by another ticket at the GOL-gate, witch costed me 781,00 euro! Arriving at Fortaleza Airport, I adressed myself to the TAP office. They gave me a mailadress where I could make my complaint. Back home, I adressed my complaint first to TAP, but the only answer I received was that I had to fill in the form on their website, witch I did, without any further respons. Since I booked my trip trough Ebookers.be, I repeated my complaint to that company, also by filling in a form on their \"customer-service\" website. You receive an automatic answer with a registration-number and the promise they would answer within 48 hours. 5 days later, I still had no answer. I send them a reminder, but even 2 weeks later, there was no further respons. I send Ebookers another, rather angry mail, on witch they responded the same day with excuses for the delay and the answer that they transmitted my complaint to TAP and that I could expect a compensation by TAP for the extra cost I had to make. Now, 3 months further, I still have no answer or payment by TAP or Ebookers. I presume that mail with complaints are directly transmitted to the \"unwanted mail\" or the \"trash\" map! I don't know how to proceed further in this mather to get any positive answer or repons by either TAP or Ebookers. But it is certain that I cannot recommend these companys for any other trip or flight!\n",

I'm just wondering what will happen to our baggage. It's all on the same ticket so I'm presuming its tagged all the way through to MAN? We have just a 45 min connection time between landing in PHX and getting the AA flight to ORD, and so we're not sure if we have to collect our baggage from the carousel and drop it somewhere or if it will be transferred for us so we don't have to worry about it after checking in at LAS, Anyone with experience/knowledge of this can help ease our minds?

      "My daughter will be travelling Gatwick/Malaga on her own with her baby who will be 18 months old. She will be taking hold luggage and a small backpack as cabin baggage. She will be fine getting on the plane at each end as she will be able to take the buggy up to the entrance of the plane, but unfortunately it then goes into the hold and is put on the carousel at the other end. Her problem will be how to manage the long walks when departing. The baby is already very heavy and although can walk a bit, will not be able to walk long distances. She is too heavy for my daughter to carry through to security. Has anyone else had this problem? I was thinking of her using special assistance but that really for disabled passengers.

      "I made the unfortunate mistake of booking an emergency trip to the UK thru Minneapolis to LGW with Northwest. In the past I always had good luck with MSP but apparently they have been in the midst of runway work and flights are delayed or cancelled willy nilly (although you can bet it's the smaller cities whose flights are cancelled), Couldn't get into Minn to connect with the UK flight and NW \"service\" was little help. Apparently this has been going on frequently, yesterday the flight got to Minn too late to make the connection. If we had been warned earlier in the day, we could have driven to MSP in 4 hours and made the connection. All NW would offer by phone was a late Thurs flight to Detroit that got into LGW on Friday far too late for us. This suggestion also made it clear that NW wasn't going to guarantee we would be able to get to MSP Thursday eiher. Luckily we listened to the business travelers in line and did not trust the info given by phone, so we stayed in line and the in-person clerk (who was also helping unload planes at the same time) was able to reroute us to get to LGW three hours earlier which gives us a good shot at making the services. It may take all of Thursday to get to Gatwick but at least it's a chance if it all goes well. To add insult to this, while on hold with NW, they were playing an ad offering bonus miles to fly into Msp!!! If they had any kind of conscience they would be warning potential passengers of the delays and they all should change their schedules to avoid these delays. Oh, but then they might lose business, better to have a captive angry passenger than no passenger at all. I have not flown United for quite a number of years since that summer period when they were also stranding passengers in Denver and Chicago. I'm afraid that I'll be avoiding NW, especially their Airlink, for at least that many years after this. I can't think of any other business that I have been lied to and manipulated by for years and years as much as by the airlines. There was a time when I really did enjoy traveling, but that was before the hubs, maximizing seat capacity, disappearance of snacks and cancelling flights to make sure the other flights have no empty seats.\n",

The return is the reverse with Zurich-Chicago on Swiss and Chicago-Seattle on United. I selected this routing because I wanted to purchase from United but fly Swiss for the transatlantic. I already have my seat selections on United through the reservation process, but not on Swiss. I have the Swiss confirmation number from the United web site, but, when I go to the Swiss site, I am apparently not allowed to see or manage the Swiss segments on the Swiss website due to the codeshare. I could use some enlightenment on the process for online check-in on both outbound and return flights and seat selection for the Swiss legs so your input much appreciated. I've flown commercially frequently, but am still a bit inexperienced with codeshares. With United-Air Canada booked through United, I could use the AC locater provided by United on the AC web site to get to my reservation. Seems a bit different this time.\n",

      "I was surprised to discover recently that I am only a few hundred miles away from Medallion Status on Delta. I say \"surprised\" because I generally don't fly enough in a year to get the necessary mileage for any kind of airline status. However in this case I benefited from a couple of trips to the west coast earlier in the year, plus two sizable MQM bonuses that I received courtesy of my Skymiles credit card. I have some long haul trips planned for later this year and early next, so decided to have a go at a Mileage Run to get the remaining miles for the status upgrade. Since I'm new to doing Mileage Runs, I decided to try something not too terribly ambitious - just enough miles to push me over the threshold. I've read that ATL is not a great airport to base out of for this sort of activity, but I did find an inexpensive R/T flight to Louisville that departs on a weekday afternoon, has a short layover at SDF, and then returns to ATL by about 8:00 PM on the same day. It cost about $145 altogether and I'll get 1000 miles out of it - not such a great deal in terms of cost per mile, but for a first effort I guess it's not too bad (plus it's a small financial investment if I have to back out at the last minute out for some reason). Anyway, here's my question. My biggest concern with this is that something will happen in Louisville (delays, etc) and I will miss the return flight to Atlanta. Both flights have the same flight number so I am guessing it's the same physical airplane for both legs. Does anyone have any idea if that's a valid assumption? I figure worst case I can do a one-way car rental and drive home (6 hours) if I miss the return, but would obviously rather fly (note that I only need the outgoing miles for the status upgrade, so no real harm done if that happens). That's really all I wanted to know, I guess. I know that FlyerTalk is probably a better venue to discuss this sort of thing, but I am not active over there (yet!). My wife is very dubious about all of this and thinks I am crazy, so I am just trying to allay some concerns. Thanks for any advice you all can offer. -JimG\n",

Due to the cancelation, we miss our flight from Gol Linhas Areas (from Cordoba to Sao Paulo). After 3 hours waiting, the aerolineas employees schedule a flight to Buenos Aieres in 23/06 at 06:00. So 11 hours later and from a different place. They do not arrange another flight to São Paulo, neither a Hotel. We paid everything from our own (USD 150 from hotels and taxis)and went to Buenos Aires without a granted flight to Sao Paulo. It was possible take a flight to Sao Paulo just in 23/06 at 17:55 from TAM Linhas Aereas paying from our pockets (USD 1000 each one). We lost meetings, and personal arrangements in Sao Paulo due to the cancelation. Furthermore we have a lot of stress (nobody grants us that it would be possible to come back to sao paulo). Aerolineas do not do anything to help us. For luck we had money to do everything from our own. We have all the vouchers and receipts to prove the extra spending. It was an unfortunate experience together Aerolineas and Argentina. Never more we would choose this wretched airline. Furthermore, we will charge everything (all the extra costs) from Aerolineas. If necessary we would contact ANAC and the court. I’m a current flyer (special member from LAN/TAM) and never happens to me. Moreover, if I wasn’t a special member from TAM I would not arrived in Sao Paulo because there wasn’t available flight for us and Aerolineas did anything.\n",

This time around when I picked my bag from lost and found at Catania, I also had a dogana tag on it. My bag was supposed to be checked through to the Catania,and it was always going to go through the secure dogana area where it would be scanned, but the bag went missing in Rome so I was not with the bag when it was scanned. My question is did customs open my bag at both airports? Everything in the bag was a mess this time round, but I'm not sure if this was because of the way it was handled.

      "Hi we recently arrived back from a trip and took flights with Airasia form KUL to CEB we had pre-booked meals for both flights along with exit seats. As we are now Coeliacs (no Gluten) we just booked the basic meals eg Chicken and plain rice. Once on board the meals were served and thats when we noticed the ingredients list on the packaging (contains gluten) so we could not eat the food i explained to staff they said to contact customer services and explain. On arrival I contacted Airasia via the website and explained everything eg, The website states that some of the meals may contain gluten, When in fact ALL of the meals had gluten, so I requested a refund of the return flights pre-booked meals which was some 10 days away. This request was of course rejected but i was given a link to the site again to select and pay for new meals lol that of course i cant eat any. Plus Airasia have a 'no outside food policy' I had anticipated that the level of service from them would be zero, so we did bring some snacks. The moral of the story use yoru mastercard as I did and dispute the transaction on return then they wil actually listen as the Booking was made from the UK our rules apply regardless of the lack of clarity on the Airasia site so I will update the outcome, for me its not about the £20 its more about the priciple now so fight on ;)\n",

      "Just saw this from FlyerTalk and the SFO website - \"San Francisco International Airport (SFO) will conduct a series of temporary runway closures during 2013 to accomplish construction activity for federally-mandated Runway Safety Areas. These closures will primarily consist of weekend closures of either Runway 28L or 28R, which are the primary runways for arriving flights. Only one runway will be closed at any given time. During closures, the arrival rate at SFO will be reduced from 60 aircraft per hour to 30 aircraft per hour. Delays for flights originating within a two-hour radius of SFO are expected to occur during peak travel times. Peak times are between 9:00 a.m. to12:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Travelers are strongly encouraged to contact their respective carriers regarding any potential delays.\" flysfo.com/web/…updates The dates listed are ... Jan. 11-14, Jan. 18-21, Jan. 25-28, April 5-8, April 12-15, April 19-22, April 26-29 , June 25-26 and and June 27-28 . Runways 28-L and 28-R are used for long haul takeoffs and for virtually all landings. The important point to note is that flights to SFO originating at an airport within a 2 hour flying time, will be subject to delays. These airports cover most of the west coast, from San Diego (SAN) in the south to Portland (PDX - my home) in the north. Seattle is a 2hr15 flight from SFO, so may not be immune. These delays already happen when bad weather hits SFO, as flights from nearby airports are subject to flow control. Should bad weather and these closures hit on the same day(s) it could be big time problems. If you have a flight to SFO and an onward connection for these dates, as referenced above you'd be advised to contact your airline. If you're planning on connecting via SFO from a nearby airport on these dates, allow an enormous amount of contingency, and even consider avoiding SFO altogether.\n",

      "This is a terrible, fraudulent company that luers people in through cheap airline tickets. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. My partner and I bought two business class tickets to Belize from San Fransisco and discovered a week later that there were unauthorized charges on our credit card that added up to almost double of the original cost of the tickets. Not only did they try to double charge us but then changed our tickets to coach class on the returning flight. We've been hassling with them for a week to get these issues resolved and so far only one ticket has been changed and only half of the money they owed us has been paid back. After looking this company (aka Solar Tours, Cheapticketabroad.com, etc..) on the BBB website and reading other posts about these companies, we know we are not the only ones who have been scammed. The BBB gives them an F rating. They've had to change their name several times to try and hide the fact that they are a shady company. Doesn't get any worse than that. Does any one have more information or a contact number for this company?

EVery flight out of our city was cancelled. Not my fault. Not Aeromexico's fault. These things happen. So, I called them to see how they were going to handle it. They said a refund was not an option. Fine. Act of God, whatever. So they said they would rebook my flight at a different date but they were sold out until the end of the month. And oh, by the way, I would have to pay the difference between the original ticket price and they ticket price of a different date----which was $500 more than the original ticket price, because the only tickets they had available were during the high season. I think that's poor customer service, but okay. Fine. The guy said I had 10 months to redeem it. Well, I called back three weeks later to rebook it, and he said that I only had two days to rebook the flight, that time had passed, they were taking my money and they would not be giving it back. NO ONE told me this when I talked to them originally. They made it very clear I had up to ten months to rebook it at no charge except for any difference in the ticket price. I explained this and asked to speak to a manager or supervisor. The guy on the phone was *extremely* rude though I was trying to stay calm and cordial with him. I asked 4 times before he finally agreed to let me speak to a supervisor. At which time, he put me on hold and left me there for 45 minutes. Finally, I hung up and called back. The same jerk answered the phone. I tried asking to speak to a supervisor again, and he hung up on me. What. The hell. Do NOT book through Aeromexico for any reason.

I thought all airline locator nos were standardised - 6 digits.Do airlines issue different numbers depending on whether the booking is direct or via agents?\n",

      "I wanted to pass on my experience to travelers trying to get a passport in under 3 weeks from travel date. I was caught in the Oh s$#% time frame of under 3 weeks and over 2 weeks so I could not make appointment at the Miami passport agency . I scrambled 2 and 1/2 weeks till travel date what should I do? I panicked, I read horror stories and read great stories online. What should I do I ask my self. Wait 1/2 a weeks to make a appointment and hope I can get one before my travel date. One of the passport agency worker actually in a way suggested I should wait and set a appointment. I was scared its almost june summer is here its travel season. If I wait I risk not getting appointment in time. Three phone calls to the passport agency and I get a old man Nice calming voice in my state of panic telling me to expediate it. At the time expediated was 2-3 weeks and the clerk at courts said its the 3 week mark. The passport agent told me do it, my response was what if I don't get it in time he stated \" I had a get out of jail free card.\" At 4 days prior to departure if the application is good I can request a emergancey appointment with the Miami agency.. This gave me the kick in the but to expediate it and the relief I had a back up plan.. I herd rumors that the passport agency is the only functional branch of government now I can say confidently that these people are efficient. It only took 7 days, thats right 7 days not business days but days to get it to my door. I right this so the people who are stuck on the fence at the 2-3 week mark and are scared, don't be scared. The passport agency will do what ever they can not to delay you. Suggestions don't forget to put travel date and send it threw clerk of courts or accepted post offices. These certified places make it alittle quicker than you just sending it, Best of Luck and I hope this helps someone in the same situation I was in. _=) Edited: 8:16 pm, May 28, 2016\n",

      "United decided to not go along with its plan to end complimentary hot meals in economy on some international flights. Hot meals will be included on all Trans-Atlantic and Pacifc international flights again from all UA airports in all classes. Here is the email: Dear Mr.(snip), Thank you for your direct, candid feedback on the test we had planned to launch in the fourth quarter for food choices on some of our flights. We heard you and have decided not to move forward with the test of offering customers buy-on-board options in United Economy on certain trans-Atlantic flights. We will continue to offer complimentary hot meals on those flights. The response from you and many of our corporate customers, even before we launched the test, told us what we would have undoubtedly learned had we proceeded - you value our hot meal service in economy class for international flights. In this environment, where higher costs driven by volatile fuel prices are now the norm, we must continue to tailor products and services so that we provide you with choices and competitive fares. As such, we will continue to be proactive in testing new ideas. On October 1, we will proceed with the test of new, complimentary options for United Business customers on three-cabin aircraft used for domestic routes, which represents 16 daily flights. Customers on these flights will receive complimentary fresh sandwiches, salads, breakfast, snack boxes or snacks, depending on the length of flight and time of departure. They will also continue to enjoy complimentary beverages, including beer, wine and cocktails. We will evaluate the results and determine next steps by the end of the year. It's also important to note that full meals will still be served on our p.s. transcontinental flights. Thank you again for your feedback. We will continue to listen and make changes that enable us in this environment to provide you with the choices you value. Sincerely, Graham Atkinson Chief Customer Officer\n",

      "Hi, An interesting article today from USA today's travel section-- which is essentially an encapsulation of a larger, more detailed article written by the Wall Street Journal-- that discusses historical airfares and what people pay today as compared to 1995 levels. While I've mentioned this before, I thought the article was interesting for two reasons.. First, it does confirm what I suspect most people know to be reality.. that being the **average** air fare paid today is in fact LOWER than what you paid **on average** back in 1995 when adjusted for inflation.. Again, this is an average and applies to only US carriers.. but I do think that it applies to most markets-- some more than others, but most markets.. But the more interesting thing that the WSJ author notes-- is that even when you add in checked bag fees and other fees that didn't exist as separate charges back in 1995 (the WSJ author quotes a figure of $21.66 for these fees in total) it's STILL cheaper.. 16% cheaper with the fees added into the comparison, 21% without the fees added..

      "Here is the description of my terrible experience with FlightNetwork: I needed to book round trip tickets to Copenhagen for 3 people. We searched Google flights for the best deal and found a round trip flight for $843 from Flight Network. Since we needed to book using 3 different credit cards, I called FlightNetwork for the booking to ensure that we all get the same price and availability. First, it takes the agent forever to find the flight I am talking about (even using the flight numbers). Then, the agent tells me that the price I am seeing is due to a “glitch” in the system but they would honour this price. I am put on hold for long periods of time in order for the agent to come to this conclusion. It is already 30 minutes that I’m on the call and I have no new information other than the information I already had accessed online in less than 2 minutes. I tell the agent I would like to book with 3 credit cards and apply a promo code (for $20 discount per booking). The agent then asks me for the credit card numbers. Without asking me for my promo code, she has already applied a random promo code that gives $10 discount. I was frustrated at the incompetence of the agent and the long wait times so I decided I would continue the transaction online. I hang up with the agent, go through the online booking system, put in my credit card, click on “Purchase Now”, only to get a pop up that says the online system could not confirm my fare. I refresh the page and suddenly the flight is showing up at $896. I call back 5 minutes after I’ve hung up with the agent the first time, and she tells me that flight prices have gone up. I now decide to proceed with the booking anyway as it is urgent enough for me to book this flight. Another 45 minutes goes by, again long hold times, and my 3 flights are now booked. I receive emails with details of the booking but no invoice. I told myself I would call the next day to ask about the invoice. The next day, I notice the flight is showing at $843 again! And, on top of that, when I log in to the Air Canada website to manage my booking, the purchase price is actually at $843. So when I call back FlightNetwork, I tell them about this and I also tell them that I can’t even confirm what has been charged because I never received an invoice. Again, more ridiculously long hold times - every time, I ask a question, the agent tells me to hold on, puts me on hold for 5-10 minutes and comes back throwing up an answer she received from someone else. What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question. Initially, the agent tells me that she says I was charged $843 mistakenly. I am so confused. Then, she comes back and says oh no, it was $896 that you were charged. Complete chaos!! She sends me the invoice which says that I am paying $285 for the flight and $611.57 in taxes totalling $896.57. Then I tell her that the flight is back to $843 on their website. She says she cannot see this price in their database. I am literally refreshing the page as I speak to the agent and am seeing $843. I had to send a screenshot of what I am seeing on their website to them to prove that I am seeing this price!! She then says that because the flight is book, she cannot refund the difference but can provide it as a credit due to their price drop protection. I was not satisfied with this but looked like I didn’t have another option so I agree and she tells me that it will appear in my account within 3-5 business days. It has been 4 and still nothing but we will see. During the call, I ask to speak with a supervisor and she tells me that the supervisor will basically tell me the same thing… The total time for this call was 1 hour. Then I finally see the charge on my credit card - I see 2 charges. One with the description AIR CANADA totalling $843 and another with description TASF totalling $53. I google TASF and find out this mean travel agent service fee. I am so furious now as they never informed me that this was part of the price they quoted to me!! It is not even detailed in the invoice. I tried calling and the agent tells me that this doesn’t need to be detailed to me, it is part of the total price but I am still not convinced. This is only $53 but the principle of the matter, I was not informed of the details of the charges to my credit card, let alone the absolutely horrible service, I am sure this is in violation of some consumer protection act or travel agents act. Overall absolutely terrible terrible nightmarish experience with FlightNetwork. Not worth the headache and lack of transparency. Embarrassing that this is a Canadian company.\n",

      "I thought I would share our experience. If you have any questions, please ask. Thomson Flight Booking: Easily done online with no problems. We booked extra legroom seats and we felt the cost was worth it. Seat Selection: This was done online as well and it was simple. My only complaint is that we wanted two aisle seats and it wouldn't let me. Online Check in: I checked in a week ahead of time and printed boarding passes. Again, simple and easy. Night before luggage drop: We dropped off our luggage the night before with no stress or problems. I love being able to do this. Flight: Boarding was on time and very efficient. We did take off about 20 minutes later than planned. The flight was comfortable. We had bought a Boots Meal deal at the airport before we went to the plan. So, we did not purchase anything on the plane. We booked extra space seats and they were good value for my tall husband. The flight is about 3 hours from Manchester. Luggage & Immigration in Naples: we disembarked quickly upon landing to a bus. At immigration, the lines went quickly. We had a little wait for the luggage and then off to our transfer. From landing to our transport heading to Sorrento, it took about 1 1/2 hours. The return trip was just as simple and easy. We were pleased with our flights and now look forward to our trip on the Dreamliner this summer.\n",

Although I certainly understand Boise (or as I call it, Spudville!) is NOT a travel hub of any sort, it just shouldn't be this complicated to buy a ticket online, without involving a travel agent! In looking at Korean Air, Cathay Pacific, etc--one cannot \"start\" from Boise, even though they are partners with airlines that do fly into Boise. I really don't want to travel on two separate tickets. I have also tried Matrix--which is usually very helpful in finding a good \"routing\" and price from Spudville. In the past I've found my itinerary, then just gone to the airline website to purchase the ticket. Worked like a charm for last two trips to Europe! With Bangkok, this isn't working--the fares are MUCH higher on the airlines websites than Matrix, and I can't enter Boise as a starting point. I'm looking at traveling mid January 2012 for about 4 weeks. Flying into and out of BKK is fine. Any suggestions or help is much appreciated! Thanks!\n",

We signed up for trip alerts and didn't receive any but one that said they were ontime. Instead they were 4 hours late leaving Toronto and did not notify or communicate this to anyone until 15 minutes before when we were supposed to board. They made us wait for over an hour for a voucher for Lunch and then we got $5, which doesn't buy much more than a coffee at Pearson International. We paid for Premium seats because we had heard the seats were tight and then ours seats were double booked. We were worried about lost bags and went with carry on. When we arrived there were people that had lost luggage, I felt especiaily sad for this young teenage girl who was in tears on the bus ride to the resort. Coming home was no better. Web check in wasn't even offered on the way back Delays again coming home and the sign at the gate continued to read on time, even though they were not. They forced us to check our bags or pay several hundred dollars to carry them on even though we had less then when we went down and the bags were standard carry size for any other airline. We arrived so late that we had to pay for a hotel stay at the airport when we got back. On the 7.5 hour flight down we had one drink service that happened 3.5 hours after we boarded.

My wife and I just returned from a round trip via Delta from Charlotte to Jacksonville, FL. We flew first class cheaper than a coach seat on AA. From the moment we stepped up to the ticket counter in Charlotte until we got our baggage back at the end of the trip, it was amazing to experience the difference in service. The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing. Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat, fresh blankets, pillows, and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground, and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles. Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings. The entire crew was dressed very sharply, smiled, and actually thanked us for flying with them. They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service. Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crews....it is common place on AA. It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable. On each leg of the trip, our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim. AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutes. Best decision we've made to switch our business to Delta.\n",

The inflight service on the flight from JFK (772-200LR) was pleasant and seats were comfortable and were flat for sleeping. The airline's grounds services at JFK is not efficient for a large group. There were no Pre-Boarding areas for Executive or Business classes at the gate. The ground servive at BLR was also very inefficient and transit service at BOM was HORRIBLE. The flight from BOM to EWR on 747 was acceptable with good inflight food service, but non-existent entertainment and the seats were not flat. The transit at Heathrow (a refueling and more passengers stop) was the most miserable experience in all our flying years....We would not recommend to anyone flying through Heathrow as transit passengers. Their security staff is rude and there is no concept of organized boarding at Heathrow. Incidentally, there is barely enough time to exit the plane with all your belongings, go through security and make it back to the gate before the plane is supposed to leave.

On our return flight, which we bought tickets for (and paid for and reserved seat assignments, frequent flyers miles numbers, special meals), we discovered Turkish Air re-sold our seats and I guess cancelled the reservation. The result was the absolute worst seats in the back of the plane, not sitting together as a family even though we were travelling with a child. Also, we apparently don't get frequent flyer partner miles with this airline either, even though the Turkish Air agent on the phone and the ones in the airport assured us we would. We will never fly Turkish Air again and will never use Expedia either. If you want to go to Egypt, use Egyptair. Much better everything---customer service, flight attendants, food, AND they are on time or actually leave early if everyone is checked in! Never, ever fly Turkish Air. Terrible\n",

The problem is that I've asked this question 3 times with 3 different telephone reps at Travel Guard Insurance and I've gotten 3 different answers. I don't think the telephone reps understand this either. My question is this: When buying the policy, you have to put down on the application \"trip cost.\" Using BA Avios points for a Business Class ticket, the taxes and fees which I paid were about $1100. (OUCH !!!) The first agent told me to insure the cost of the actual ticket. (I knew this wasn't correct so I called back.) The second agent told me I could only list the cost to re-deposit the points in case of cancellation. This would be $65 USD. I wanted to double-check, so I called back a 3rd time, and the 3rd agent told me to put down the cost of the taxes and fees. In case of cancellation, I would get the taxes and fees back from BA.

We've never used travel insurance because except on one occasion we've always booked our own flights, hotels, trains, etc. That said - I've noticed a number of posts on this and other boards gently chiding people who've encountered problems in their travels for not purchasing trip insurance policies.

Our luck held, as the no-fly ban was lifted on the day we left (in fact, our booked tix were on the first UAL flight allowed out of Brussels).

      "Volaris charged me over $700 for my infant daughter to fly with them, despite the fact that it's against Mexican federal law to charge for an infant. I had purchased tickets for my wife, daughter, and myself online with no problems. Upon arrival at Zacatecas (ZCL) for our flight to Chicago Midway (MDW), they said \"the system\" wouldn't let them check her in because she's two years old (despite the obvious fact to the contrary according to her Mexican *and* US passports). They couldn't get \"el sistema\" to let them issue a boarding pass because we were within the month that she turned two (she was 1 year, 11 months). They gave us the ultimatum: buy a full price ticket or don't fly. Not wanting to miss Thanksgiving dinner, we caved. But, as they were trying to buy the ticket for her as an adult \"el sistema\" wouldn't let them because she was not yet two years old!!! They eventually lied, entered an older age, and gave us the Customer Service number and email address for a refund. Essentially the *same* thing happened on the return flight... except this time they said they had absolutely no record of her ticket and forced us to buy another one. Naturally, customer service at Volaris is a joke in English or Spanish. In Spanish, they'll talk down to you, tell you it was your fault, and stonewall you. They'll refuse to let you speak to a supervisor. In English, they'll sound very nice and helpful and then do nothing, saying they'll call you back after checking with the airport for more details. Surprise, surprise, they never call back. If you then call them back, the supervisor (if you're lucky enough to get one... usually the reps just refuse to connect you) will not take your call, leaving you on hold for hours. If you hang up and work your way through Customer Service to the same supervisor... he'll tell his reps to tell you \"he'll call you right back.\" Two months later, and many, many hours on the phone, still no refund. Next stop PROFECO? Anyone else have this problem? What's the next move (besides obviously never flying with them again and advising everyone I know to do the same)?\n",

      "Hi, has anyone had any problems with HMPO online form when submiting their passport application? I applied for my first adult passport in July/2014 by using the online form available. Approximately six weeks later I received a letter saying I needed to complete a whole new form, this time in paper form. I contacted HMPO and asked why, since my application was complete and with no errors. They told me it was because I had missed Section 4 (details on parents). I went back into the online form, this time taking screen shots with date and time, and surprise, surprise there was no Section 4 in the online version of the form. I was never given the opportunity to write my parents details. I repeated the process several times in different dates and managed to get to the end of the form (screen to complete payment and submit). I tried contacting them by phone, but they insisted that despite the problem I had to go through the whole process again. I tried complaining, had no replies. Phoned again several times, then they finally said they could not find my application, then later on they \"found\" it but that there was no way around it. As a result I have waited for my passport to be processed for more than 8 weeks now - and still no idea when it will be finalised. I read in a similar trip advisor forum (\"Problems with the Passport Office,dated April 2014) that some people, Miss B and Nanny503927 for example, were having similar problems. I would not recommend use of HMPO online form for new applicants... And i was wondering if anyone has had similar issues. Thank you\n",

I booked some flights and elected to pay by Direct Deposit to avoid the credit card surcharge. As my bank is the same as theirs the transaction was processed immediately. Two working days later when I checked my itinerary, it was flagged as pending, unpaid. As when I had originally made the payment it said that the booking would only be held for two days I was a little concerned and phoned their customer service department. When I eventually got through, after some discussion I was asked to send a copy of my bank's confirmation of payment, which I duly did. Later that day I found the itinerary was now marked as paid so I was happy enough with that. However, this morning a Jetstar rep called me to check that everything was now OK and ask if I had received my itinerary (which I had). Not only that, but she had to call four times before I was available to take the call, which I thought was pretty good follow up, I would have thought they'd give up after the second try. They did leave voice mail, but only to say they wanted to speak with me personally, so they also didn't take that out and call it good. I was impressed, better service than I expected.\n",

      "I have not flown internationally in a long time....or even domestically since the invention of the TSA. I therefore had some trepidation about the flight, figuring it would be a royal PITA, no food, and generally where the end would justify the means. Wrong. I chose British Airways Open Skies from Newark to Orly because I had always had good experiences with BA. Also, I liked the idea of a smaller plane with less people. It seemed to be a bit more civilized. I was not disappointed even though we traveled economy. The seats were leather and comfy, and not quite as narrow as some. Our seats were the first row in economy, so although not separated by a wall, there was a lot of leg space between our seats and the last row of business class. We were not treated as if we were the inferior class. We received iPads, a full meal which was quite good, as well as a small breakfast snack before landing...all at no additional cost. Upon the return we were two in three seats, which was terrific. We had a sizable snack, a full meal which was also quite good and another snack prior to landing. The flight crew (captain et al) on both flights were terrific....informative and very personable. The flight attendants were very pleasant, professional and helpful...and love the uniforms as they have a chic retro vibe. Along with the pillow and blanket we received a packet with eye shades, socks, and another item I can't recall. Boarding and disembarking were both a breeze although upon Orly arrival we did not have jetway access but had to disembark on the airfield where a bus waited to take us to the terminal. On the return to Newark we hit a wind shear upon touch down which the female pilot handled very admirably. Luggage retrieval was painless...again, due to far fewer passengers. One point...the 757-200 is a narrow body jet. Therefore the aisles are narrower than many other types of aircraft. Therefore, any bump in the air will cause you to bump the passenger in the seat if walking in the aisle, or be bumped if you are seated. Other than that, the flight was like flying used to be, when passengers were treated like humans, and not cattle. IMO, all,others airlines should,take a page out of the BAOS book. I would fly them again in a heartbeat. Now all they need to add is in flight WiFi, and the service would be perfect.\n",

I want to make sure you know I'm not one of those people. When booking my trip I did request assistance from Allegiant with my luggage, moving through the airport and security, to the gate, and on and off the plane. I tried to be as specific as possible as to the assistance I needed since I was traveling alone. These requests were not out of line and should have all been provided by Allegiant. Instead, Allegiant asked my family member who was dropping me off at the airport to help me to my gate which was a huge inconvieniece for them. On my first leg the gate was changed before the flight and another passenger had to move me to the new gate. But that was nothing compared to how I found my wheelchair every time I received it back from Allegiant after landing. After the first leg, the left arm rest was broken off. I didn't say anything at that time thinking that it was just a \"things happen\" situation. I really lost it though when at the end of my second leg, as I was being wheeled down the ramp, the young man who was wheeling me down wheeled my left wheel partially on the edge of the ramp causing the rubber tire to come off my wheel!! Then he started telling me how it was \"normal wear and tear\". REALLY?!?! When my husband and I got back to our car we inspected the chair closer and found that the edge of the back of the chair had a rip in the vinyl!! It's going to cost me more to repair this chair than it will to just replace it. What makes me so angry is that no one says sorry. My husband worked for an entire day to make this chair fit my personality by painting it sparkly hot pink since I have to spend so much time in it. Now though, I'm house bound because they just didn't care to take care of something that is so important to me. I did contact them, I guess they have 30 days to respond.\n",

      "I`ll always remember when we went to China back in 2008, the weather in August was too hot for me but the country was fascinating and the Eclipse was fantastic : aerialsandtv.com/…ChinaEclipse Unfortunately BOTH our suitcase failed on the same trip ! And, significantly, the zips went on both of them. So we needed new cases, we wanted strong hard shell weatherproof ones (having seen what happens to soft cases left out in the rain......) and, most importantly, no zips. And we found them ! American Tourister \"Flite\" (Samsonite`s budget range). They`re not the lightest in the world but built like tanks, plastic tanks I grant you, but tanks none the less. You`ll always see loads of them owned by seasoned travellers on airport luggage carousels. They came with a 3 year guarantee, but 4 years later after loads of hard use we needed a spare part for one, it just screwed on and they just put it in the post, for free ! That level of customer service is rare indeed these days. Anyway, earlier this year a friend of mine wanted my advice on what suitcase to buy. I`ve seldom been so certain of any recommendation, buy the American Tourister hard shell suitcases we bought back in 2009, but guess what ? Yes you`re right ! They don`t do them anymore ! In fact they don`t do anything similar and neither does anyone else (well Samsonite do one model, but that was a bit out of her price range). The question is why are all suitcases on the market these days flimsy soft and zipped ? ! ? Edited: 4:15 pm, September 20, 2012\n",

Prior to take off in Perth we were joined in the row in front of us by 3 drunk men who from that moment on set about drinking the cabin dry. After an hour, the one in front of my wife suddenly decided to put his seat into a full recline position hitting my wife in the face. We complained and verbal hostilities arose. We were moved 5 rows back. This was not the end of our troubles. From that point onwards we were threatened contiunally by these men. This was pointed out to the crew. Approaching to land I was told by \"the leader\" that they would be waiting for me in the corridor. This was heard by a Stewardess. A terrifying experience all round. Nothing happened in the corridor but we were on edge continually. Luckily for us, they did not continue on our joining flight to Heathrow. I emailed a complaint to Malaysia Airways and 4 weeks later they have replied sending a 3 line email back saying thanks for my observations and they will review their practices on future flights. The questions is. Do I now leave it at that or is that the best I can expect from a 5 star airline ?????\n",

I tried to complain several times before my travel and even trying to rearrange flights etc and there was no help anywhere so I bascically had to put up and shut up. My issue was I saved money up for a while to be able to treat my mum to a little break away (personal reasons). I booked through low cost holidays iv had holidays through them before with no issues but this time when booking I specifically chose the return flight with Thomas cook and paid a considerable amount more to return with them as theirs was a later flight. After a couple of months I had another email confirmation through as Thomas cook had rescheduled their flight which was 7 hours earlier than the original time and also earlier than other flights I could of chose and paid less for! this resulted in us losing near enough a day off our holiday and also losing out on the extra money I spend choosing to fly with them. Ive tried to complain to low cost holidays but they say its not down to them so my complaint should be to Thomas cook but then when I try to complain to Thomas cook its void as I didn't book with them directly so I basically cant complain to them. Is their a higher body in which I could complain to as this seems to just be a vicious circle and I'm not getting anywhere?\n",

A 7+ hour flight with a family of 4 behind me. The kids were an infant maybe 4 months old and a 2 year old. The kids alternated crying, screaming, howling and seat kicking the entire flight. Parents did nothing to stop this. Directly beside across the aisle were 2 parents with Junior lap baby that looked way to big to be a lap baby. Just before the lunch service Dad decided he was going to change Junior's very soiled diaper right there in the seat. From my vantage point, I could both see and smell everything that was going on. Absolutely vile. Needless to say, I was shocked. Just before landing, round # 2. The parents just rolled up the used diapers and placed them under the seats! The aircraft bathrooms had diaper changing tables too! A lack of class by these parents. Wondering if anyone else has witnessed such rude behavior lately while flying?

Some of my fellow passengers were looking at me very strangely. Turns out that they guy behind me had one of those little dogs which look like a gremlin in a tiny dog carrier under my seat. It continued to yelp incessantly for about 45 minutes. You wouldn't think a little dog could squeal so loud. It wasn't really a bark, more like it was trying to squeal and bark at the same time. Most people around the area reached for their headphones including me but even that could not mask the little tyke out. Was not until I got up for my headphones and mentioned that the dog seemed distressed and that perhaps he should try to calm it down that he picked the poor thing from under the seat. He seemed oblivious to the noise it was making, perhaps he was immune. Give me a screaming child over this little begger any day ;-)\n",

      "I've posted a few questions on here about getting through a particular airport. I like to over-prepare and know exactly where I'm going. So far I haven't had much luck in getting exact answers. So here's the thing: I have a connecting flight in Frankfurt (coming from Nuremberg, heading to the US) and it's 2.5 hours. I take a bus from the plane to the terminal, and have to somehow find my way to my next gate. I look at maps and still don't know what way to go. I'm sure I'll figure it out when I get there, but I know that until then I'll worry. I'm trying not to stress over this, but I am anyway. Any advice on getting through large airports without going insane and/or getting lost and missing my flight?\n",

      "So i know this was a HUGE thread last year,and probably still ongoing,but I didnt want to hijack it 80 pages in.... What are the latest thoughts on refusing to switch seats,especially when there's retaliation? My flight last night from JFK-FRA on Lufthansa was PACKED,and I guess a lot of people had their seats screwed up(so the pilot said as we were taxiing to the runway). I was on an aisle of a 4 seat section,and the guy next to me asked if I would switch with his wife,who was in the row ahead of us,in a middle seat. I declined,as I tend to be a somewhat anxious flyer(i dont show it,but I do need aisle access) and i reserved my seat 2 months ago. The guy was disgusted of course(the guy on the aisle seat next to the wife must also have refused) and proceeded to sit the entire flight with his legs in a V-position,leaving his left leg halfway under the seat in front of me.He also threw his blanket all over him so that it came into my seat(which i picked up and put over the side of his armrest-no fuss,just removed it from my lap) and stood in the aisle when i went to the restroom once and refused to let me back into my seat b/c \"he needed to stand.\" I could have went to an FA,but it was a 6 hour flight and I didnt want any more issues. Plus I knew there was nowhere else to be moved. Thoughts?? Also,it was definitely a rude guy flight-the passenger in front of me reclined his seat ALL the way back(which is their right,I know,so i did the same)and complained to me that I was bumping the back of his seat everytime I moved around in my seat or got into my bag(which I did once or twice). I did tell him that if he pulled his seat forward he might not notice me as much,but he kept it where it was. Needless to say,the flight was just peachy. Lufthansa was fine,though,service was good despite the passengers. We had in seat entertainment,decent food,plenty of beverage service and free alcohol. Anyway,feedback is appreciated. ------\n",

      "I recently booked Ryanair flights for my husband and his friend. When I began the online check in, I realised the surname of the second adult, the friend, was wrongly entered as the same surname as my husband although his first name was correct. I had failed to notice this on the confirmation email. Rang Ryanair and they said it would cost £160 for them to change the name or £110 if we did it ourselves online. As the hotel was booked, we had little choice but to pay the £110. Protests that the mistake was not ours fell on deaf ears. I wrote to their head office but they refused to be of any assistance. Some googling showed that others had experienced a reversion of the second adult surname to that of the first adult when the website goes to the payment page. I believe this is what happened to us. It also appears their terms of contract may be considered unfair. So I intend to sue them in the county court and wondered if anyone might have any experiences of doing this with Ryanair?\n",

      "I booked and paid for a flight on CheapoAir between 2 European cities. Later that day, I saw the carrier offering the same flight, class, limitations on their own website for literally more than 2/3 LESS than what I paid. I provided all the necessary documentation to CoA as instructed under their \"Lowest fare guarantee'. They denied my claim because the carrier's website 'is not a US website'. They cite the lack of a US customer service number as a basis. (Note that an effort to use CoA's US phone number resulted in a 53 minute wait, followed by a disconnect, so I had to use online chat anyway.) I don't see the relevance, other than to contrive a way to not meet their advertised promises, However, it gets worse. CoA sent me a hotel coupon to use in conjunction with my (disputed) flight. I decided to use it to shave my loss. Found the hotel I wanted on the dates I needed. I provided all the information including full credit card data. Agreed to CoA terms, hit Confirm, and received a confirmation of - ANOTHER FLIGHT! Nothing about a hotel., No email confirm. Nothing. Now, forced to endure the one hour phone wait, I spoke to a representative who claimed that AmEx had rejected the charge. I called Amex and they denied that. Lie # 1. The CoA rep (still on the phone) told me she would book it directly, but after several minutes, told me the hotel had sold out, and would I like to book somewhere else? That is Lie # 2, because I promptly went to (very reliable) Hotels.com and successfully booked exactly what CoA had originally offered at the same (pre-coupon) price. I also confirmed the booking with the hotel itself. I've booked many air and hotel tickets with CoA, and never had a problem. However, I also never tried to do anything even slightly out of the ordinary, like use a coupon or rely on a guarantee, This is a trust business. Buh-Bye, CheapoAir,\n",

      "Since Usairways merger with American our service and prices have suffered out of Charlotte. My last experience made me vow to never fly them unless I absolutely had to. My wife and I just returned from a round trip via Delta from Charlotte to Jacksonville, FL. We flew first class cheaper than a coach seat on AA. From the moment we stepped up to the ticket counter in Charlotte until we got our baggage back at the end of the trip, it was amazing to experience the difference in service. The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing. Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat, fresh blankets, pillows, and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground, and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles. Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings. The entire crew was dressed very sharply, smiled, and actually thanked us for flying with them. They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service. Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crews....it is common place on AA. It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable. On each leg of the trip, our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim. AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutes. Best decision we've made to switch our business to Delta.\n",

Once in Minneapolis we were told by Delta that we did not have reservations to fly to Fargo , even though the ticket we received did show a flight , we were then told to see a United ticket agent , and that was in a different terminal . Well off i went , unfortunately the first agent i found was on the phone , he proceeded to tell me , by putting his hand on receiver that he will be on the phone for awhile , i then grabbed my TICKETS and proceeded to the next gate , still not knowing whether we had a flight . The next terminal had an agent dealing with a client , 2 other people were standing just behind the gate having an animated conversation , after 10 mins 1 left and went back to original United gate ..The agent was off the phone , looked at my tickets , reprinted them and said YOU DO have reservations for that flight , go see delta . Off i went to delta again , different terminal again , I was again told by Delta we did not have reservations and I need to go back to United !!!!!!!!!!! At this point I was probably I step away from loosing it , the agent then offered me the United PHONE NUMBER !! ..... After some enormous restraint I insisted she call !! She told me to have a seat , finally I i overheard her mention they had marked an HL or something on the ticket or reservation !!! I have no idea what that meant , shortly after she called us up and asked for our identification !!! we received or tickets and proceeded to our gate ... c 9 then c 10 and then f 1 .... We were a party of 4 , 2 of witch are mid 70 senior citizens , in the 13 hours it took , every time we had to bounce from terminal to terminal they went with us , this was very stress full on them , we had originally boarded united in vegas Friday flight 6659 friday ..I have not checked my credit card statement but we had 2 rooms booked for late check in 130 am saturday morning in Fargo ,ND , as Fargo was not our final destination , so i may find i have been charged for these rooms as well .

      "I recently returned from 3 weeks in Europe after flying with BA a few times and just wanted to share my experiences I had with the airline. ---- from YVR to LHR: Departed on time, arrived at LHR 20 minutes early. I paid about $100 extra for an exit row seat (28J) and couldn't recommend this more. The seat is located in the first row in Economy, right behind Club World. After takeoff, they close the curtain and due to there being no toilets here, there's no one walking around to disturb you. My seat was right beside the door which kind of protrudes out. This was used as my leg rest for the entire duration of the flight. If you can't afford Premium Economy, this is a really great option. Dinner was a choice of pasta (with feta and tomatoes) or chicken (with rice and veggies). I had the pasta which was actually quite tasty - by no means a five star meal, but not bad for plane food. The chocolate dessert was delicious. After dinner service, lights went out and it was time to sleep. A word of warning - it's extremely cold by the exits. I had a blanket and jacket but I was still shivering throughout the entire flight. In hindsight, I'm not sure why I didn't ask for an extra blanket - I must have been delirious with sleep... Breakfast is served about an hour before landing. It consisted of a fruit muffin, yogurt, and a box of raisins (?!). Not very filling, but oh well. IFE was average - I only watched one movie before going to sleep. The new releases were nothing to get excited about, so it may be wise to bring your own entertainment. BA85 from LHR to YVR: My experience on this flight was similar to the above, except this time I had seat 29K. This is also an exit row seat but in the second row of economy with a missing seat in front which allows you to enter the aisle by walking in front (and not over your seat mates). It was a good seat but not as good as any of the exit row seats in row 28 which just feel more spacious. This flight departed a bit late and arrived 45 minutes late at YVR. I also flew from LHR to BCN (BA486), and AMS to LHR (BA435) on their smaller planes. Both plane interiors looked brand spanking new. I managed to score exit row seats on both these fights as well which was a nice bonus even though the flights were quite short in duration. There's no IFE but they do serve a small snack and free drinks on both flights. I don't know what the snacks were as I declined them on both flights. Overall, a very good experience with BA. They're definitely my airline of choice when flying to, from, and within Europe, especially if I can get an exit row seat on the international flights. Edited: 11:28 pm, July 13, 2015\n",

Any domestic travel included in your ticket will probably be on South African airline Comair, operating under the British Airways banner. BA/Comair has a “policy” (it happened on both of my flights) of selecting passengers at random and asking them to leave their hand luggage at the door when boarding, as “the cabin is full”. Don’t do it. I did, and had a phone stolen from my bag. When the crew approached me at the door, I asked them if they would stow the bag on board, meaning in the cabin. They said they would. Instead, I ended up collecting my unlocked bag of valuables (minus one) from the carousel in the terminal. To add insult to injury, my bag was well within the regulation size, it fitted comfortably into the overhead locker (on the return trip) and it was all unnecessary as there was plenty of room in the lockers anyway. When I complained to BA at the airport I was told I should not have left valuables in my checked-in luggage! Had I not been so sleep deprived after a long international flight I might have been more circumspect when ambushed by the crew.

      "A Qantas Boeing 747 traveling from London \"lost power from all four of its main generators 15 minutes away from Bangkok, and the pilot was forced to switch to battery back-up for the landing,\" The Sydney Morning Herald reports. The Australian newspaper says the Monday incident \"is set to prompt a worldwide alert to Boeing 747 operators after the problem was traced to a cracked drip tray under the first-class galley.\" In a story from this morning, the Morning Herald says \"water from the blocked drain collected in a drip tray under the floor. A crack in the drip tray caused the water to leak into electrical wiring. Each of the plane's four engines has its own generator, but the water shorted out the aircraft's power supply.\" David Cox, Qantas' executive general manager responsible for engineering, tells The Australian \"it was just like tipping a glass of water into your stereo.\" Dr. Arvind Sinha, director of aerospace at RMIT University in Melbourne, explains to the Morning Herald that \"the engines have their own independent power source and the steering is operated by a hydraulic pump system, but the critical issues are the navigation and communication systems that you need to find your way to a runway to land.\" Colin Adams of the Australian and International Pilot's Association says the Qantas crew and passengers were \"lucky\" that the plane was not far out over open water when the incident occurred, according to the London Daily Mail. \"In that situation you have a minimum of 30 minutes before you lose power to the flight instruments,\" Adams tells the Morning Herald. \"After that the only idea that you have of airspeed and where you are in relation to what's around you is what you can see out of the window. There is no written procedure for what happens in that situation -- it's the pilot and his wits. If you were a long way from an airfield at night it would be an extremely hazardous situation. If you were in cloud you would not know where the ground was and you could end up in an extremely dangerous situation.\" The 747-400 is now back in service for Qantas, according to The Associated Press. \"As a precaution, Qantas has inspected its entire B747-400 fleet and all of these aircraft have been cleared to fly,\" Qantas executive John Borghetti tells The Telegraph of London.

Would I buy trip insurance from Germany? Or would they buy trip insurance from the US? Also I've yet to hear any good stories about any travel insurance company so any personal experiences would be much appreciated. Thank you!\n",

      "EasyJet have announced they will close their base in Madrid this October, pulling all eight aircraft out and redeploying them elsewhere across Europe. Although only 20% of services will be lost within the next year, EasyJet are still selling tickets as normal through the winter season with no route or frequency cuts at all other than Manchester and schedules still show early morning departures and late night arrivals in Madrid, which shows that aircraft is based there. Why are they still selling these flights when us who take only little interest in the aviation industry know they won't happen but others less so will not? I'd say for the time being people DO NOT BOOK EASYJET FLIGHTS TO/FROM MADRID POST OCTOBER 2012 AS THERE'S A CHANCE IT MAY NOT FLY! Give it a couple of weeks or so unless anything happens before hand. Anybody remember when they closed East Midlands flights? They sold them and people were booking them when EasyJet knew they wouldn't fly at that time. Same seems to be happening here!

Allegiant Flight was 45 minutes late taking off from Memphis because they were \"still loading baggage.\" We arrived in Las Vegas 1 hour past Arrival time. As we landed, the announcement was made to lower all window shades & place seat belts in seats, as the plane was scheduled to depart again quickly. Waited 45 minutes @ Baggage Claim. No bags. Passengers flooded Allegiant Office, where it was \"determined\" that the baggage was not in LAS, nor was it in MEM. & No there's not another flight from MEM today. Maybe tomorrow? By the time most had spent 20 minutes filling out Lost Luggage Forms, I (not one to give up easily) asked an Allegiant Associate if they were sure they had checked all possible cargo areas? @ This point, I'm thinking:: \"Surely they didn't put a whole flight's luggage on a plane to ???\" That would make no sense. It HAS to be HERE!!! She made a phone call:: \"Has anyone checked the middle cargo compartment?\" Held for a few minutes. Then \"Yaaaaaaay!!!!\" Duh . . . 1 more hour before we could retrieve it from the belt. So 2 hours 45 minutes of wasted gambling time.

We really enjoyed it and it was a great way to feel like the vacation has begun even before take off. Anyway, we will be flying VS again for our next trip but in PE this time. I was wondering if it is still possible to gain access to the lounge? Thanks so much, in advance, for your tips and suggestions!\n",

      "Just my luck. It's my Daughter's 18th today. Had a meal planned to celebrate for ages now and my flight booked months ago. Got up at 0530 this morning to get ready to go to the airport and had a text from Easyjet to tell me the flight was concelled. Blooming heck I said, or words t that effect, what am I going to do now? To top it off I forgot that they sent me a mail ages ago changing the flight to 1020 so not only have they cancelled I got up two hours early:-((((( Not blaming EZY for the horrendous snow but I tried to call customer services at 0600 and was on the phone for 30 mins before giving up. I wanted to see if I could change the flight to go to MAN then catch a train which you can't seem to do online, only reschedule the flight or get a refund. Anyway I have managed to get on KLM (€220 !) but not until 2100 tonight. There was a flight at 1500 but after procrastinating about what to do and hanging on the phone to Easyjet that quickly filled up as KLM also cancelled their morning flights to and from EDI. Moral of this story is don't hang about in these situations. Carpe diem and grab the next available flight before some other bugg3r does. Anyway will miss the meal but these things happen. Never had a flight cancelled before due to weather but it would have to be today of all days.At least EZY managed to let me know by text and e-mail BEFORE I left for Schiphol. By the way flgihts to Glasgow for the next few days were over €500 on KLM. I only wanted a seat not an executive jet!! Moan over ;-)\n",

It's hard to find detailed information on hotel websites, and I can see from some tripadvisor reviews that some hotels only have hourly shuttle services (in which case it's probably worth getting a taxi for early morning flights, and I'll price that in when making my choice). Last time I had a 1 night stopover the hotel only operated a small minivan to get to JFK in the early morning (despite using a bigger vehicle the night before), and we had to wait over 10 minutes for the driver to try to squeeze all the passengers and luggage on, with some luggage/passengers ending up on other people's laps, and some left behind.\n",

      "I know Jetstar regularly get a slating for their delays and bad service, so thought it was only fair I shared the excellent experience we had with them recently. We flew Christchurch NZL to Narita Airport, Tokyo via the Gold Coast Airport. The flights were on time going over, no issues with delays or connections. The flight was delayed an hour coming back, but apart from that we had no issues with onwards connections, lost bags etc. The planes were lovely and service great. The thing that impressed us most was regarding our request to have luggage on the way back. We had booked a while back when they had a 2:1 special (2 fly for price of 1). We booked our basic flights ex Chch. Over the next few weeks we got several emails changing details of our flight. For the most part these were tiny changes: change of terminal, flights changing times by 5-10 minutes (in our favour), however, one of the changes was canning the return flight to Chch and putting us on a flight to Auckland, then a domestic flight to Chch. We didn't have any choice but to accept this as our trip was on quite a tight timeframe. Later we decided that we wanted to have one person with 10kg baggage on the way back to allow for a few souvenirs we planned to get. When we went to do this online, we found that it would cost us $98 (which we were prepared to pay) plus $15 more because of the domestic flight we now had through the change to their scheduling. We decided to wait until the airport and ask them there to waive the $15 as it was not our choice to do that leg. The lady at the airport counter spent quite a bit of time going through our booking history, then she handed us our boarding passes and said no problem. I pulled out my cc to pay for the Narita-AKL baggage and she said there was no charge for that either. We had asked for one person to have 10kg and she loaded 15kg baggage on both our tickets for free. We thought that was pretty good and were happy with that! When we got onto the Gold Coast-Auckland leg of our return flight we discovered we had exit row seats and then when the food trolley came round, the hostess informed us we each had $10 voucher for food. This was our first time flying long haul with a LCC. Even without the freebies we got as compensation for the change of return flight, we found it a good experience and would happily fly Jetstar long haul again out of NZ/Australia.\n",

The reality here, of course, is that there really is nothing unbusiness-like or underhanded, nor are there any \"bait and switch\" tactics in what these sites offer or what they charge as YOU authorize the total amount of charges which you agree to pay when you \"submit.\" It isn't worth complaining if YOUdon't exercise reasonable care -- and READ THE FINE PRINT beforehand -- when using such sites. One thing to always be sure of is that you see a physical address for a legitmate place of business and someone whom you can contact should a problem arise.

They say I have a credit for $1833, but won't let me use it. 8/29/07 I am a physician working in Walnut Creek California. I bought (11/ 6/2006) three United Airline tickets ($1833 visa receipt is attached) from Cheapoair (internet site located in New York) to fly from San Francisco to Cancun on January 20th, 2007. Due to changes at my job, I cancelled my flights well in advance of the departure date. I was told I would now have a monetary credit (minus a $100 penalty per ticket) that could be used for one year. I called and reconfirmed this numerous times. I have been trying to make new reservations for over three months now. At first I tried to use the credit to go to New York (see emails), now I have been simply trying to rebook my original itinerary (SFO to CUN). Every representative tells me I have a credit for $1833, and that they can make me a reservation, but when I go to book the flights they say they have to talk with their booking department and will get back to me. They never do! I have cell phone record of hours of conversation time. I have also sent numerous emails, including a final warning that I would be filing a criminal complaint.

Entertainment system is top notch, with large screens, and plenty of movies, Tv, games etc, there is something for everyone! Another thing I love about SIA is the legroom.

Two different groups applied for their Esta's. An email was received to say Authorised after the initial word on application said Pending. We could not book in online, it came up as check in at airport. We arrived at Heathrow at 02:30 for a 6am flight. The passport machine would not let us check in. We were directed to different desks around the airport, the final one being the Special Assistance desk. There was already a family with a problem at the desk and there was no senior members of staff to help us. We were told there was a problem with our Esta. We promptly got the Esta number up on our mobile devices but the check in staff said it was too late to book 9 people in and closed the flight!!! We were told to go to the ticket desk and buy new tickets! There was no staff from TAP airlines to help us. The manager eventually came back from the gate and agreed to talk to us. After much discussion we were booked on United flights the following day. Our party of 9 were split up into 5 and 4. 4 going first via Newark, then 5 going 5 hours later via Houston. They would not discuss how we wanted the party split resulting in my daughter's friend flying with our other family members. We were due to arrive in Miami on Sat afternoon but got there Monday morning. We were at Heathrow for 32 hours with children. Tap would not help us with a hotel, meals, nothing!

Anyone know which one is correct or have checked a car seat in for free (when only booked flight and not on a thomson package). Many thanks for your help.\n",

      "My partner and I recently flew back from Barcelona to Heathrow with BA. The flight was delayed by 2.5 hours, resulting in our getting into Heathrow after midnight, when all public transport other than taxis had ceased running. During the flight, we were told on two occasions by crew that if passengers were to take a taxi home, this would be refunded in full by the airline on presentation of a receipt. On arrival, we received a quote from a London black cab for £85-90 to North London. This would normally be an excessive expense for us, but as it was 12.30am we took the taxi in order to get home quickly (and in the understanding that reimbursement would be forthcoming). The final fare ended up being £97. However, on making a claim and presenting our taxi receipt, we were informed by BA's Customer Relations department that we would only be refunded £50 as the full amount was considered 'beyond reasonable' and it would be 'unfair to other customers' to make an exception. After querying this further - and stressing that passengers were explicitly told that they would be 'fully' refunded for any taxi journeys - we finally learnt (via a response from the airline's Twitter account!) that the maximum compensation given for transport is £50. I wondered if any others have experienced something similar? I think it's fair to say that we and the other passengers were misled by BA, who promised something only to fail to deliver, leaving us considerably out of pocket. They also appear to be completely oblivious to the actual cost of a standard taxi from Heathrow to London! If anybody has any suggestions on alternative channels for proceeding with this, it would be much appreciated. I have already considered raising it with the CAA. ----\n",

Here it is: I have friends and family members who can't or won't be bothered to mail presents (and money is not the problem). They save them up for when I visit and then give them to me then, expecting me to take them back on the plane. Sometimes these gifts are quite bulky; and, as I travel lightly (almost always without checked luggage, and usually with just a back-pack), they never fit into my luggage. On one occasion I ended up checking my backpack to bring the present on board as a carry-on; on another occasion, a family member mailed me the present (and didn't tell the giver that she was doing this). I've kind of had it, and would frankly prefer not to receive anything rather than have to pay $25 to check luggage or put another family member out.

For single flights, we can get the same prices, flying over with Singapore and returning with Etihad, BA, or Qantas. The costs for the two one-way fares is pretty similar to the return fares. Up until today I was pretty sure we would go with the one way fares, mainly because Singapore has such a good name and we could then try (mixed reviews) Etihad on the way home, or Qantas if we wanted the old faithful. What changed today was that Cathay has come into the game with a very competitive return fare and I have heard that they are on a par with Singapore.

      "I recently flew with Thomson and would never do so again. I flew with one checked bag at a meagre 20kg, and my usual hand luggage bag on wheels. All was perfectly fine on the way OUT (hand luggage was given a cursory glance and declared to be fine), but coming home was a different story. The officials at Crete weighed my hand luggage and found it to be overweight. I had NEVER had hand luggage weighed before, even on the Thomson flight out. I was sent to a different desk in order to check in my hand luggage as a second bag for the hold. I was told this would be €25 and begrudgingly agreed to this, pointing out that this had NOT been a problem on the way over for the SAME bag. Upon reaching the desk, I was told that ON TOP of the €25 I had to pay an amount per every kilo this bag weighed. I was presented with a total fee for checking in a very small hand-luggage sized bag, of....wait for it....€133! The staff were rude, dismissive and told me this was Thompson policy and the airline was rigorous in its baggage checks. This obviously only applies on your return flight, where you have no other option of leaving stuff, and struggle to understand the language and make yourself understood. I felt bullied and was reduced to tears. During discussion, I was told my flight was completely full - it was not. I was also told if I didn't pay up, the €133 would be taken from the pocket of the lady working on the Thomson desk! (really?!) There were other people queuing, all bitterly upset with the surcharges dumped on them for the return flight only. I eventually rectified the situation by donating my beach towels and books to Thomson, and wearing approx 4kg of my clothes, thus saving myself €133. Hideous end to a lovely week, all faith in Thomson GONE. PS credit to the amazing cabin crew staff who looked after me on the return flight - i could have hugged you all for your kindness.\n",

      "I booked a round trip ticket (w/ 5 days in between departures) for 360.00 USD on virgin air. I heard wonderful things: \"Its modern\" \"Everyone is so friendly\" \"Free wifi\" \"great in flight entertainment\" \" Electrical outlets at every seat!\" I was sold! I thought I got a great deal ( never flown to nyc before and 360.00 seems like a steal) But now, im a little nervous. Maybe I've been reading too many reviews by 'difficult passangers' but I have heard : There is only free wifi on flights from sfo to jfk, all others must bay 13.00 usd most outlets don't work ( was a common complaint I've heard..) no free inflight drinks or snacks ( not even water?) inflight movies and ther entertainment are available for an undisclosed fee. Now, im not by any means a difficult passanger. I pay attention during the safety lecture, bring my own food and drinks as well as a book or two and most of all, I realize the flight attendants are there for safety and not to be a 'sky waitress' But after reading/ hearing all that I can't help but feel like I got a bad deal. I adore jetblue and I feel like I should have booked with them, I could have had a free cold drink mid flight and some basic cable incase I tire of reading. Im traveling with my elderly mother who walks with a cane and I have heard that VA may or may not allow an attendant with the person who is pre boarding. I worry that she may not want to board with out me or she may have a hard time navigating the rows alone. Do you think a attendant would be willing to walk slowly behind her incase she loses her balance? Im really just looking for some real experiences from agreeable passengers who have flown VA and, to see if I got the great deal I thought I did. Thanks for your help. ( and honesty!)\n",

      "I travel on Firefly (the \"budget\" airline under Malaysian Airlines) for the convenience of flying out of Subang Airport. Recently, I opted for the 'taxi' booking to add on to my travel booking from the Firefly website. Let me tell you - NEVER opt for this. The airlines charged me MYR6 and it is really for no good reason and it was not explained clearly in the website. I was under the impression that \"for my convenience\" I could book a cab to get to the airport and this was the cab fare. It is not. It is merely to have the cab company call you to ask whether you need a cab!!! Which you can do for free on your own. So, in addition to the MYR6 you pay to the airlines, you will need to fork out the metered fare plus MYR10 (because you booked the cab as opposed to flagging it down at a cab stand). Do not get cheated by Firefly by opting for this \"taxi service\". I demanded a refund from Firefly and was promptly told I can complain by sending in an email to the airlines!!! How's that for service??!!\n",

      "I have been a Life Member of Qantas Club for years but generally, these days, choose other airlines. For all the smoke and mirrors, Qantas is very ho-hum , ergo, dull and boring. After a series of serious in-flight incidents, the proud kangaroo has had a bit of PR disaster. While Qantas has not had an accident/incident where people died, tarnished is the operative word for them. They are gradually whittling away any benefits at all. Recently I booked with their subsidiary, Jetstar, Sydney - Honolulu return with business options. Here, the add-ons they normally charge to go cattle are generally included. I have a cattle class Sydney-Brisbane return with them as well and that has add-on costs galore. My real beef is the dreadful Jetstar website and lack of connection with that of Daddy QANTAS. In spite of endless patience and a very fast Internet connection, the Jetstar site is woefully slow and has severe Alzheimer's! The site continues to insist that I have no booking for my international leg although I have a confirmed itinerary and a booking number: absolutely a denial that such a booking exists. A call to their customer service department took two days to get through! It kept ringing out or I got a number unreachable message. When I did connect, I was assured there was such a booking but not according to my profile. However, the domestic booking is there! Go figure! With well over 400,000 frequent flyer points, Qantas has a couple of reward options for flight redemptions but of course, taxes can be extreme so one might just as well buy a ticket anyway. To sum up, Qantas is a dead duck and I avoid them generally. My loyalty is focused elsewhere!\n",

      "I just called to clear the outstanding balance of 6 day trip to NY which cost my friend and I £400 EACH - bargain (or so we thought). When I called a few wks ago to pay of £590 I was informed that the airfare taxes had risen by £20pp. At the time of booking the agent who booked the holiday said it was possible that they would rise once before the o/b was paid off but not by much. I was a bit annoyed that I hadn't been called/emailed and informed of this, and that it was casually mentioned at the time of payment but I accepted it s I was told they need my \"ok\" before they could deduct the £590 off my card. I asked at least 3 times if the taxes would rise again and was told no repeatedly. All was fine and with the new £20pp tax fee ...my outstanding balance now stood at £64.90 and my friend's was £54.90. I called today (the last day to pay off the booking) to pay the final £119.80 and am told \"Oh it's £150 you owe madam and if it's not paid today you will lose the holiday\". I've had the worst week imaginable and completely lost my cool as I found it incredibly cheeky that they appeared to have plucked this sum out of the air as I had had my o/b confirmed to me repeatedly during the last phone call 3 weeks ago!! I disputed the o/b and went through the maths with the woman on the phone who couldn't understand what I was saying and was in a bloody call centre in India and who said that she'd escalate my complaint to a manager who'd call tomorrow...cue more ranting from me that today was the last day to pay the o/b and that a phone call tomorrow would be useless if she was saying that I'd lose the holiday if it wasn't paid off today. I asked to be transferred through to the sales team as she was in the customer services team and seemingly in a differennt country! After being put on hold for a while an English sounding guy came on the line, asking what the problem was..at this point I'm in tears as I'm so stressed out and he tells me \"You won't lose the holiday as you're talking to me now. You called us, it's fine. Your tickets have been dispatched anyway\". He says that the price of the holiday may have gone up and didn't I get any emails from the woman who booked it for me bk in October. I haven't heard from here since the day I bloody booked it!!!!!! I tell him how I was told that the taxes would not be rising again and how I'd budgeted down to the last penny for what I believed I owed. He gave me this agents direct line telling me she'd be in tomorrow 9:00-5:30pm and that she knew more about the booking and would be able to help me. I'm so angry at this shoddy service from Travelocity. You can't go adding money onto peoples outstanding balances without informing them beforehand!!! I lost my job recently so money is tight at the moment and to say I'm still shaking with anger is not an exaggeration! I was in bloody tears to the guy on the phone. I'm so stressed out at the moment. They can't do this again can they??? They'd have the call on tape where I was told in no terms would the taxes be rising again.. I wasn't even told by the lady in India where the additional £30 had come from!!!!!!!! Will be ringing the lady who booked the trip for me first thing tomorrow morning but would appreciate any advice if possible. Many thanks for reading my rant ....*and breathe*\n",

That wasn't a big drama, but a bit annoying when you book through an agent for some service. The real problem started at the airport, we tried to check in but the airline had no record of our booking even though Orbitz had issued us paper tickets showing apparent valid ticket numbers. I tried to call Orbitz at the airport but by the time I finally got to speak to someone and have them understand that a) I was at the airport trying to check in b) No, i didn't want to cancel my booking and c) I am Australian, so my zip code has only 4 digits, we were forced to purchase new tickets at the airport to be able to board at a cost of around $250 before check-in close. Since the flight, I have tried to contact Alitalia about the issue, with no response whatsoever and Orbitz by email, who just say to call. When I call, I'm repeatedly put on hold (paying international call rates) and was told on the last call that \"Orbitz will not refund the tickets as the airline re-accommodated us on a later flight.\" They do not read my emails or listen to what I have to say (ie. we only got on the later flight after we purchased new tickets), just keep repeating the line that the airline put on a later flight. I don't want a refund for the original tickets, I want a refund for the more expensive tickets that we had to purchase at the airport! Any ideas of what else I can do?

My preferred route is Leeds- AMS- then either Portland or Seattle with a Delta on an A330-300 which I always enjoy in economy class. A very late booking, and looking for the cheapest flight, means that next week I fly KLM to LAX on a 747 which I did last summer. Inbound though, from Minneapolis to AMS it is a Delta 767-400ER. I was just idly wondering if it is much different to the A330 which I normally fly on and which has a great choice of films....I normally watch more films on a flight than I do the rest of the year at home!

      "Dear Readers I recently (June and July2010) travelled to Europe from Australia with my wife and 3 children aged 16,11 and 9. We visited France, Greece and England. I booked and paid for 3 flights with Easy Jet prior to our departure. The first two flights were uneventful. However our last flight from Athens to London ended up blowing my holiday budget out of the water. We were booked on an Olympic Air flight out of Paros in the Greek Islands a flight that is 20 minutes in length and was scheduled to depart at 16.05pm. Our Easy Jet Connection was due to depart at 19.00 and check in closed at 18.20. Due to the late incoming plane to Paros we did not arrive in at Athens airport until 17.55pm and we were promptly transferred to the terminal by an awaiting bus and were in the terminal at 18.00. I advised my wife and children to go and retrieve the bags and I raced up to the Easy Jet counter to commence check in. By the time I got to the counter it was 18.18pm on my watch and on the clocks in the terminal but there were no Easy Jet staff at the check in at all. The next day there was an Air Traffic Controllers strike that had been scheduled and we had non-refundable accommodation and other paid activities in London. I went looking for the Easy Jet representative in the Terminal who advised that as it was at that stage, 18.21pm by her watch the flight had closed, there were no staff available and there was nothing she could do other than advise us that due to industrial action and bookings we would not be likely to get paid seats with Easy Jet for 3 days. Faced with this I looked for flights departing to London that night and found a British Airways flight due to depart at 19.10. I was advised by a BA representative that she may be able to get 5 seats but would not know until 18.40. She managed to get 5 economy seats for which I was charged in excess of EURO2500 or Australian $3557.00. I spoke to BA the next day in London and a staff member told me that I was charged adult fares for the two children under 12 and that I should be entitled to a 25% refund. The battle to do this is still going on with the BA refunds section and the initial response that I received when the matter was referred to BA customer relations was that BA only have 2 classes of economy seats adult and infant ie 2 and under. There website would suggest otherwise. I have written to Easy Jet and am awaiting a response and will detail it in this forum when it is to hand. I think the moral of this story is that allow the widest possible berth between connection if travelling on a discount carrier. Do not accept the check in closure time will be adhered to by staff of a budget carrier and make sure that you have travel insurance that covers the scenario of a missed connection, as many policies in this regard will only give you a limited amount in very limited circumstances. I will keep you all posted. ------- Sydney\n",

      "We returned Saturday evening from London via British Airway. Part of our bucket list (things we want to experience before we \"kick the bucket\") was to fly British Airways First Class and/or Business Class. I hope anyone with a love of travel and have traveled for many years squeezed into \"the back\", can have this experience!. All you need to do is save up those Frequent Flyer miles for years and years of loyally flying the Star Alliance airlines in the narrow, crowded seats and keeping a sense of humor knowing you are doing your favorite thing, traveling to far away countries. We will probably never again be able to afford to travel this way, certainly not enough time to collect miles nor save enough money....BUT , the memory of this experience on British Airways will last until the end of our days. In past years when I traveled domestically first class for business with my employer paying the fare , it was NOTHING like this. Airlines, and service have come a long way, Never could I imagine this experience. I remember boarding in the back, under the tail, and walking up the aisle, and using a pillow for a tray....Ahhh, and now sleeping pods, pajamas, slippers, 5 star meals, top shelf spirits and the most polite incredible flight attendants, obviously the creme de la creme.. Now, we two \"mature\" people celebrating our 50th anniversary, know what goes on behind the curtain!. I hope all you lovers of travel can share the experience one day.\n",

That is why I was so glad to hear Pres Obama himself proclaiming the wonderful advances in passenger processing at DFW for US Citz plus anyone travelling with ESTA. Therefore I was horrified by the 3hrs line up yesterday at DFW, making hundreds miss their connections (I had booked a 4hr connection - so we made it). The reason for the lines? 3 booths out of 28 were open. 1hr later they opened 16 more. Yes, there were 6 international flights landing within 20 mintues of each other, but in this day and age they must surely be fully aware of the number of passengers on each flight, their nationalities and their exact arrival time - many hours in advance. And to think we travelled via DFW in order to avoid LAX - not next time we wont Rant over !\n",

      "Some of you may remember my post from last year: tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g1-i10702-k64972… The thread appears to have been frozen, however I resurrect it now to give you an update ... Until last week I hadn't flown from CWL since the incident in the previous thread, but last Monday once again my contact lens solution was selected at for testing ... Once again, the staff were polite and professional - but this time I was prepared! My regular \"explosive\" solution was in my checked luggage, and in my hand luggage I was just carrying a 100ml bottle of solution that Specsavers said shouldn't test positive - and they were right. It passed the swab test and I was allowed to take it with me. In all the years I've been travelling I have never had contact lens solution tested at any other airport (apart from once in Bilbao, when they suspected it was something totally different - but that's another story ...), but maybe this will help anyone travelling through Cardiff with contact lens solution in their hand luggage - they seem to be on the lookout for it (I was assured I was simply chosen at random, though I'm sure I spotted a look of glee in the security staff eyes when they saw the bottle going through the X-ray machine ...). For clarification, the solution that tested positive was Specsavers' Easyvision Allpurpose solution; the \"safe\" solution is the Easyvision Multipurpose. If anyone needs a 100ml bottle, they have a stock in Specsavers in Queen Street Cardiff ;-)\n",

We're flying British Airways from LHR to Singapore, but our connecting flight is on Jetstar, and as we have quite a long time between flights in Changi (12 hours), we would like to make use of the transit hotel. However, as we will not be checked in from London straight through to Bali, we will have to reclaim our bags from the BA flight and then check in to the Jetstar one. As far as I can tell, both airlines use Terminal 1. My question is: will we be classed as transit passengers and therefore be able to use the transit hotel? My concern is that we will have to clear immigration in order to collect our bags, but then find that we are stuck landside and unable to use the hotel because check-in for our Jetstar flight to Bali doesn't open until several hours after our flight from London arrives. If anyone could put my mind at rest I'd be most grateful - thank you!\n",

If you booked Premium Class this went up to 45kg PER PASSENGER!! I've been in touch with them and they refuse to budge! I've since cancelled my holiday with them and booked through Cosmos and got exactly the deal I was after..... 3 weeks in Kenya to look forward to, and 45kg of luggage each.

      "Always one to reduce costs, Ryanair are implementing cost saving initiatives. With the rising cost of fuel the airline has found ways of reducing the fuel bill by reducing the weight it carries on its flights. They will be shrinking the size of its in-flight magazines from A4 to A5 size, carrying less ice on flights and believe it or not, \"encouraging\" staff to watch their weight - with the motivation of appearing in the annual Ryanair calendar! But Ryanair are only following in the foot steps of other airlines ... In the 1980's, American Airlines claimed that they saved $40,000 by taking out one olive from every salad in first class and more recently, Japanese airline All Nippon Airways started asking passengers to go to the toilet before boarding in a bid to reduce carbon emissions! Without fuel you cannot fly, but I think that's taking things a step too far !\n",

Things that are putting me off are: (1) I've noticed over the past couple of years that because now most people are checking in online, the queues for the online check-in desks are often actually longer than the queues for people who haven't checked in online (2) Last year we had a 12 hour flight delay - the original plane had a problem and the airline then split passengers into two groups and people who had NOT checked in online were flown out on a much earlier plane than those who had checked in online - goodness knows why.\n",

The airport — in the midst of a massive facelift — has shrunk considerably, leading to serpentine queues that regularly delay flights.

      "Our son lives in Atlanta and from time to time we get our grandchildren to come visit us in Florida. They have been flying in and out of Orlando on Air Tran. Now this is NOT a rant post against Air Tran but I am going to start flying them on Delta out of Melbourne. Reason being that the last two times we went to Orlando the service was so slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow that they missed the booked flight. Their luggage made it A ok but it took so long to get me a gate pass after they were checked in that we did not get to the gate in time. The problem seems to be two fold. First of all there are NOT enough agents to handle the load. Second is that you must stand in a line that is at the very end of the ticketing area and do not have a dedicated agent to deal with. So you must wait until another line is empty or another agent comes from the \"back\" to assist you. Maybe it is just Orlando and not Air Tran but I have never had any of those problems flying from Melbourne. Additionaly the security at Orlando is poorly organized and the TSA agents are in no hurry to get you to the airside on time.

      "I appreciate that there are still alot of stranded people out there and I hope you all get home soon. but here was our story. I thought it best to wait 'till we all got home so we can give hopefully a balanced perspective of events. We were due to fly home on 15th April, when it all first happened from Atlanta. We were about 250 miles from the airport, just waking up in our hotel room when we heard the news on CNN, and obviously devastated. It was more the \"not knowing\" than anything else. The website (BA) told us not to go to the airport, and it was about 2.5 hours to speak to someone on the phone. We had to go and return the rental car anyway at ATL so had some hours to calm down and think a bit, rather than turn up to check in totally unaware and panic. The news in the U.S on this was fairly low key at the time from what we saw, and we got more information by logging on to UK news websites, it really felt like doom and gloom from what the media were saying. On our arrival at check in, we handed in my pre printed boarding passes to the BA check in staff, and decided just to book ourselves on the next available flight out, which was 6 days later. Again feeling devastated by the wait and potential additional expense that wasn't budgeted for (or so we thought). The kids were upset, the wife too, however \"keep calm\" I said to myself, trying to hold it all together ,as there is nothing you can do. BA check in staff were truely exceptional, along with ATL dispatchers for the flight (BA226 ATL-LHR on 15th Apr '10). Although they could not doing anything about the flight, their service went beyond the call of duty in terms of help, advice, and being put up in a hotel nearby with all meals paid for. BA, the hotel staff, ATL staff, and the British Consulate in downtown all worked together for the benefit of the passengers. All of them worked 110% to help us, and it will never be forgotten. I was aware of the other horror stories from other airlines just \"dumping\" their passengers with little more than $7 per day to survive on. We remember a group of 4/5 parent helpers looking after 20 or so kids who were representing the UK in a robotic tournament in Atlanta flying on an American airline who had to start paying out of their own pockets. I hope you got back safely if you're reading this. We also rememberd at the consulate, another passenger \"dumped\" by another European airline, with no one to talk to, speak to, or given any advice until the Consulate stepped in. There are hundreds more I know, and we are lucky to be what I think are the fortunate few who flew on BA. I'm not one to hype up BA, as I had some reservations on flying with them, but after this experience, and if I ever decide to fly again then there will only be 1 airline to choose from. I hope everyone can receive some form of recompense. Up to then my faith in British society had been strained to say the least, but this experience is something I'll never forget, that yes there are people out there who care and want to make a difference. I hope everyone out there still gets home safely and quickly.\n",

      "Hi, As information for any US passport holder or future applicant. New passport fees will become effective from 13 July 2010 onward. This is for all applications lodged *on or after* this date. Remember if you use a passport acceptance office (like a US post office) or one of the regional Department of State Passport Offices, it's the date on which you actually file or submit your application that will determine the fee matrix. If you are eligible to, and use regular US Mail for submission, it's the post mark date that will govern. Note that the one of the biggest increases (expressed as percentage) is in the additional page insert fee, which goes from *free* to $82 per insert added. Here's the entire new fee matrix from the DoS' Passport Services page: travel.state.gov/passport/fees/fees_5079.html If your passport is going to expire soon, will have less than 6 months validity, or you need to add extra pages, this would be an *excellent* time to do so, before the new fee matrix becomes applicable.

      "Hi. Two weeks ago we had an email from Silkair telling us they were moving our return flight from Langkawi to Singapore back a day from 26th February 2015 to the 27th February 2015. This was a disaster for me because on the 26th I am meeting up with my sister who lives in Sydney, before she flies back on the 27th. I haven't seen her since 2008. I informed Silkair of the problem and they asked if I wanted a refund. I immediately said yes and then rebooked with Air Asia to land in Singapore on the 27th. But then Silkair said they could re-route me via KL on the 27th, so I told them I had already booked the other tickets and asked for a refund. They then sent an email asking if I wanted to cancel the flights, so I said yes, and outlined the problem again. For the last few days I've heard nothing. Do you think I'll get my money back? It was their decision to change the dates of the flights.\n",

      "Yesterday I flew home from Jeddah via Doha on Qater Airways. On boarding the flight from Doha to Manchester it was quite chaotic in the forward economy cabin of the Airbus A330. Numerous families had unilaterally decided to seat themselves together regardless of their seat assignments. The poor FA spent 15 mins trying to get people into their correct seats. I reserved my usual aisle seat, but I had now been moved into a central aisle seat rather than my usual window aisle seat. I would hazard a guess this occurred to try and keep a family on the same row if possible, no big deal to be honest. However in my row was a mother and 2 children. The father of the family demanded rather than ask that I change seats with him, now if he'd been seated in business then fair enough, even accounting for his rather rude attitude. However he was seated in a centre seat behind me, I told him sorry but I dislike to being trapped in. He then became extremely rude, at which point I reported him to the FA. The FA had a word with him and he went off in Huff to his seat. Several hours later his young son looked at me and said \" your the nasty bl@@dy man who wouldn't move\" I guess that comment says it all really, clearly such language shouldn't come from a 3 yr old child. I have moved before to try and assist a family, as long as it's a similar seat close by then that's fine. This rather rude incident will definitely give me pause for thought in future. I think it was the overriding rude sense of entitlement that annoyed me. Regards Rick\n",

      "The reason of this email is to explain an unfortunate situation, me and other 10 passengers suffered at the Denpasar Airport on the 19 of December 2015. We arrived at the Denpasar airport, 19 of December 2015 with the flight VA65 from Sydney. Virgin. Now, we went to the transit Area in Denpasar and ask for Qatar Airways assistance. Nobody was there to do the checkin for transit passengers. We requested assitance to the airport personnel, but they did not help at all and told us that I we did not want to loose the connection flight, we had to do custom clearance, get our luggage and do the check in again at the Qatar desk. The personnel of the airport was disrespectful and with a total lack of customer service attitude. We had little time to decide and we finally made to the check in counter of qatar at the airport. When we did the check in, we were charged 200.000 rp which I think is completely wrong. 1) The airport tax was included in my ticket as the regulation changed on February 2015, Denpasar Airport tax was included , as I booked my flight during Sept 2015. 2) We were passenger in transit that did not get any help from Qatar or airport personnel and we wanted to take our flight. Passengers in transit should not pay the 200.000 rp. So, for the above stated, and because it was Qatar airways the carrier collecting the money, I am requesting the refund of it as I paid it twice. Another point to have in mind, right now I am at the Denpasar airport again, as a transit passenger, I arrived from Doha with Qatar airways and I am connecting to Sydey with Virgin. Virgin personnel was waiting for us on the transit counter of the airport of Denpasar, we did the check in and we did not pay for anything. So Virgin did his part on this situation, and Qatar did not.\n",

I've avoided this airline for so long, because everybody I know told me to basically avoid Aeroflot unless absolutely necessary. I'm looking for a decent ticket for my fly between North Europe and Tokyo. The cheaper the better when it comes to price, but flight duration is more important to me. I just looked up and the fastest is with either Aeroflot or Finnair for this route. But there is a huge price difference (Aeroflot is offering one-way tickets for 1/3 of Finnair's price). My dilemma is that other routs are much longer than these. I don't want to have a layover in Continental Europe because that becomes a detour. But Finnair's prices are more expensive than other airlines that offer flights from Europe to Tokyo. I'm debating if it's safe to fly with Aeroflot... I've seen comments that say it's not that bad any more. But then again, I hear horrific stories. If you've flown with Aeroflot recently, I'd love to hear your story, especially between Moscow-Tokyo.

Thomson couldn't even send a rep the next day to the Gatwick Hilton hotel with details of our departure time and on our return we should have been given a letter stating a technical problem for the delay not all the lies originally given. Despite asking for an address to write to for compensation via the rep in the Maldives she failed to give us a letter on why the delay happened, which we were entitled to and had to get a copy of this via a kind passenger. Because of the dishonesty and the fact they were spineless to confront their passengers we won't be using them again. This was by far the worst service I have received from any company and ruined a truly amazing holiday.\n",

      "We wanted to change our original round trip from Phoenix to Columbus to a three legged trip, from Phoenix to Columbus, then Columbus to Milwaukee to Rhinelander, then Rhinelander to Milwaukee to Phoenix. Our original reservations were on Southwest. Had to call customer service to change because our departure city was different, but the agent was able to help me, and we ended up with a $100 credit. Frontier is the only airline to fly nonstop from Columbus to Milwaukee, plus the only airline to fly out of Rhinelander. The first time I checked the fare was $175. Due to circumstances beyond my control, could not book it then. Last Thursday, ready to book, fare was $458! After I recovered from my heart attack, I explored other options and booked the lowest fare I could find, Delta thru Memphis, then Frontier to Rhinelander. (Knowing we'd have to pay a change fee if we had to change the Delta flights) Today I get an email from Frontier that the Rhinelander flight times have changed, and wouldn't you know, our flight from Memphis gets in at 4:20 and the flight to Rhinelander now leaves at 4:15! So now we have to stay overnight in Milwaukee!! Oh, and the Frontier agent's first response was to cancel our flights! He didn't care how we got to Land O'Lakes! Off the check the cost of renting a car for 10 days - and anyone know a decent cheap hotel with a shuttle at MKE?\n",

      "My daughter and her boyfriend had a delay last year when flying home from Majorca. We followed all the guidelines and wrote requesting compensation for the 4 hour delay. Thomsons declined stating it was extra ordinary circumstances. Basically the flight from Majorca was delayed because the flight into majorca was delayed due to ongoing planned roundworks near to the airport causing \"some staff and passengers to be late for the outgoing flight\". These roadworks had been ongoing for more than 2 weeks prior to the date and therefore all staff/passengers should have been aware of the possibilities of delays and allowed extra time. The flight was also n a Sunday evening so this should have not been as much of a problem as it would have been at peak traffic times. After they declined my daughter wrote to the Spanish aviation authority and they agreed and advised compensation should be paid to the amount of é400 per passenger. Thomsons still refused and have refused to answer any further communication. She did all the communication via the online form - should we send in one last letter by post or should we proceed to the small claims court and in our opinions do you think she has a good chance of succeeding with the compensation claim.\n",

As part of the ticket I paid the fee for Economy Comfort seat for 4 legs (JFK-AMS, AMS-EBB, EBB-AMS, AMS-ATL). Since October I've routinely checked my itinerary online and up until yesterday everything was in order. Yesterday I checked and noticed that my Econ Comfort seats for the JFK-AMS and AMS-EBB legs were missing. I've contact KLM via email; they say their records only show the purchase for the two returning legs. I emailed them a copy of my receipt showing the purchase of all 4 seats and am waiting to hear back from them. My question is: does this happen often? I looked at the seat map and the flights appear to be very full. I'm concerned that if my seats have been re-sold or given away, I will be out of luck. It's not about getting a refund if that happens, I really want those seats. 24 hours of flying is tough but the KLM Economy Comfort product makes the trip much more pleasant.\n",

      "British Airways has refused to reimburse us (wife and I) for expenses we incurred due to their cancellation of our flight. They offered $150 travel voucher each. Our costs are $470.44. We arrived at LHR at 10AM on May 24, 2013. BA advised that all flights were now canceled until 4PM. That meant our 3PM flight to CPH was canceled. We stood in line at BA Customer Service for ten hours, along with hundreds of others. Customer Service only opened 4 windows. As the hours crawled by - tempers flared. We got to the window at 8PM. No flights available this day, nor the next day - that would get us to CPH in time for the evening sailing of our cruise ship. We agreed to an 10AM standby for CPH, and a alternative code share routing that would get us close to the port where the ship would be on the second sailing day. We spent the night wandering Heathrow Airport, and retrieved our checked luggage. Not much sleep. Next morning - no luck at Standby. Rushed to the alternate plan - and flew up to Manchester UK. Then - rushed to another terminal to partner Lufthanza for a flight to Munich Germany. From there, Lufthanza toHamburg - where we arrived at midnight of May 25 - on a weekend night - without a hotel reservation. Taxied to a hotel (very lucky) and got a few hours sleep. May 26 - off to the train station: took train to Rostock, them S-bahn to Warnemunde. Hurray - that is where our cruise ship was now docked. We made it - No Thanks to British Airways - to whom we had submitted all our documentation. And - to be clear about all this: We are requesting Nothing for the Ten hours we futilely stood in line, for the stress and aggravation, for the no sleep, no food at the Heathrow airport.

      "I have recently switched to Clear Care, a hydrogen peroxide based contact lens solution, due to my eye care professional's recommendation. In a few months, this will be my first time traveling with it (by air). I have been hearing stories of TSA officers confiscating such solution in carry on baggage and not being able to negotiate citing medical necessity as a reason, even when the bottle is in compliance with the 3-1-1 limitation. The reasoning is that hydrogen peroxide can potentially be used as an explosive. I am wondering what people's experiences are with this? I have always known that it is best to have enough of your contact lens care material in your carry on baggage in case your checked baggage gets delayed. However, I now use exclusively Clear Care, and if that does not make it through TSA, I will be left with nothing upon arrival if my checked baggage gets delayed. I am planning to travel to an Asian destination, where there is almost no guarantee that I will be able to find the product for sale.

I tried to complain several times before my travel and even trying to rearrange flights etc and there was no help anywhere so I bascically had to put up and shut up. My issue was I saved money up for a while to be able to treat my mum to a little break away (personal reasons). I booked through low cost holidays iv had holidays through them before with no issues but this time when booking I specifically chose the return flight with Thomas cook and paid a considerable amount more to return with them as theirs was a later flight. After a couple of months I had another email confirmation through as Thomas cook had rescheduled their flight which was 7 hours earlier than the original time and also earlier than other flights I could of chose and paid less for! this resulted in us losing near enough a day off our holiday and also losing out on the extra money I spend choosing to fly with them. Ive tried to complain to low cost holidays but they say its not down to them so my complaint should be to Thomas cook but then when I try to complain to Thomas cook its void as I didn't book with them directly so I basically cant complain to them. Is their a higher body in which I could complain to as this seems to just be a vicious circle and I'm not getting anywhere?\n",

A 7+ hour flight with a family of 4 behind me. The kids were an infant maybe 4 months old and a 2 year old. The kids alternated crying, screaming, howling and seat kicking the entire flight. Parents did nothing to stop this. Directly beside across the aisle were 2 parents with Junior lap baby that looked way to big to be a lap baby. Just before the lunch service Dad decided he was going to change Junior's very soiled diaper right there in the seat. From my vantage point, I could both see and smell everything that was going on. Absolutely vile. Needless to say, I was shocked. Just before landing, round # 2. The parents just rolled up the used diapers and placed them under the seats! The aircraft bathrooms had diaper changing tables too! A lack of class by these parents. Wondering if anyone else has witnessed such rude behavior lately while flying?

Some of my fellow passengers were looking at me very strangely. Turns out that they guy behind me had one of those little dogs which look like a gremlin in a tiny dog carrier under my seat. It continued to yelp incessantly for about 45 minutes. You wouldn't think a little dog could squeal so loud. It wasn't really a bark, more like it was trying to squeal and bark at the same time. Most people around the area reached for their headphones including me but even that could not mask the little tyke out. Was not until I got up for my headphones and mentioned that the dog seemed distressed and that perhaps he should try to calm it down that he picked the poor thing from under the seat. He seemed oblivious to the noise it was making, perhaps he was immune. Give me a screaming child over this little begger any day ;-)\n",

What are the latest thoughts on refusing to switch seats,especially when there's retaliation? My flight last night from JFK-FRA on Lufthansa was PACKED,and I guess a lot of people had their seats screwed up(so the pilot said as we were taxiing to the runway). I was on an aisle of a 4 seat section,and the guy next to me asked if I would switch with his wife,who was in the row ahead of us,in a middle seat. I declined,as I tend to be a somewhat anxious flyer(i dont show it,but I do need aisle access) and i reserved my seat 2 months ago. The guy was disgusted of course(the guy on the aisle seat next to the wife must also have refused) and proceeded to sit the entire flight with his legs in a V-position,leaving his left leg halfway under the seat in front of me.He also threw his blanket all over him so that it came into my seat(which i picked up and put over the side of his armrest-no fuss,just removed it from my lap) and stood in the aisle when i went to the restroom once and refused to let me back into my seat b/c \"he needed to stand.\" I could have went to an FA,but it was a 6 hour flight and I didnt want any more issues. Plus I knew there was nowhere else to be moved. Thoughts?? Also,it was definitely a rude guy flight-the passenger in front of me reclined his seat ALL the way back(which is their right,I know,so i did the same)and complained to me that I was bumping the back of his seat everytime I moved around in my seat or got into my bag(which I did once or twice). I did tell him that if he pulled his seat forward he might not notice me as much,but he kept it where it was. Needless to say,the flight was just peachy. Lufthansa was fine,though,service was good despite the passengers. We had in seat entertainment,decent food,plenty of beverage service and free alcohol. Anyway,feedback is appreciated. ------\n",

      "I recently booked Ryanair flights for my husband and his friend. When I began the online check in, I realised the surname of the second adult, the friend, was wrongly entered as the same surname as my husband although his first name was correct. I had failed to notice this on the confirmation email. Rang Ryanair and they said it would cost £160 for them to change the name or £110 if we did it ourselves online. As the hotel was booked, we had little choice but to pay the £110. Protests that the mistake was not ours fell on deaf ears. I wrote to their head office but they refused to be of any assistance. Some googling showed that others had experienced a reversion of the second adult surname to that of the first adult when the website goes to the payment page. I believe this is what happened to us. It also appears their terms of contract may be considered unfair. So I intend to sue them in the county court and wondered if anyone might have any experiences of doing this with Ryanair?\n",

Do I just check in on the OS site for all legs, or will I have to check in individually for each flight? Thanks ----\n",

      "I booked and paid for a flight on CheapoAir between 2 European cities. Later that day, I saw the carrier offering the same flight, class, limitations on their own website for literally more than 2/3 LESS than what I paid. I provided all the necessary documentation to CoA as instructed under their \"Lowest fare guarantee'. They denied my claim because the carrier's website 'is not a US website'. They cite the lack of a US customer service number as a basis. (Note that an effort to use CoA's US phone number resulted in a 53 minute wait, followed by a disconnect, so I had to use online chat anyway.) I don't see the relevance, other than to contrive a way to not meet their advertised promises, However, it gets worse. CoA sent me a hotel coupon to use in conjunction with my (disputed) flight. I decided to use it to shave my loss. Found the hotel I wanted on the dates I needed. I provided all the information including full credit card data. Agreed to CoA terms, hit Confirm, and received a confirmation of - ANOTHER FLIGHT! Nothing about a hotel., No email confirm. Nothing. Now, forced to endure the one hour phone wait, I spoke to a representative who claimed that AmEx had rejected the charge. I called Amex and they denied that. Lie # 1. The CoA rep (still on the phone) told me she would book it directly, but after several minutes, told me the hotel had sold out, and would I like to book somewhere else? That is Lie # 2, because I promptly went to (very reliable) Hotels.com and successfully booked exactly what CoA had originally offered at the same (pre-coupon) price. I also confirmed the booking with the hotel itself. I've booked many air and hotel tickets with CoA, and never had a problem. However, I also never tried to do anything even slightly out of the ordinary, like use a coupon or rely on a guarantee, This is a trust business. Buh-Bye, CheapoAir,\n",

      "Since Usairways merger with American our service and prices have suffered out of Charlotte. My last experience made me vow to never fly them unless I absolutely had to. My wife and I just returned from a round trip via Delta from Charlotte to Jacksonville, FL. We flew first class cheaper than a coach seat on AA. From the moment we stepped up to the ticket counter in Charlotte until we got our baggage back at the end of the trip, it was amazing to experience the difference in service. The comparison between first class on Delta and first class on AA is amazing. Delta on each leg had chilled water bottles waiting at our seat, fresh blankets, pillows, and the flight attendants came down the aisle and took drink orders on the ground, and seamlessly replaced empty water bottles. Snacks were first rate and included fresh fruit and unique offerings. The entire crew was dressed very sharply, smiled, and actually thanked us for flying with them. They seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service. Not once did passengers get berated by the flight attendants to hurry up so they could have an on time departure by the Delta crews....it is common place on AA. It was as if we stepped back in time when air travel was enjoyable. On each leg of the trip, our luggage was waiting on us when we arrived at baggage claim. AA is lucky to get it to you within 30 minutes. Best decision we've made to switch our business to Delta.\n",

      "Date: Sun, 27 Feb 2011 12:51:29 -0600 13 hours late , the only positive was the polite and professional Frontier counter ticket attendant hit by a wave of frustrated , tired united passengers at 4am at the Denver terminal.. Once in Minneapolis we were told by Delta that we did not have reservations to fly to Fargo , even though the ticket we received did show a flight , we were then told to see a United ticket agent , and that was in a different terminal . Well off i went , unfortunately the first agent i found was on the phone , he proceeded to tell me , by putting his hand on receiver that he will be on the phone for awhile , i then grabbed my TICKETS and proceeded to the next gate , still not knowing whether we had a flight . The next terminal had an agent dealing with a client , 2 other people were standing just behind the gate having an animated conversation , after 10 mins 1 left and went back to original United gate ..The agent was off the phone , looked at my tickets , reprinted them and said YOU DO have reservations for that flight , go see delta . Off i went to delta again , different terminal again , I was again told by Delta we did not have reservations and I need to go back to United !!!!!!!!!!! At this point I was probably I step away from loosing it , the agent then offered me the United PHONE NUMBER !! ..... After some enormous restraint I insisted she call !! She told me to have a seat , finally I i overheard her mention they had marked an HL or something on the ticket or reservation !!! I have no idea what that meant , shortly after she called us up and asked for our identification !!! we received or tickets and proceeded to our gate ... c 9 then c 10 and then f 1 .... We were a party of 4 , 2 of witch are mid 70 senior citizens , in the 13 hours it took , every time we had to bounce from terminal to terminal they went with us , this was very stress full on them , we had originally boarded united in vegas Friday flight 6659 friday ..I have not checked my credit card statement but we had 2 rooms booked for late check in 130 am saturday morning in Fargo ,ND , as Fargo was not our final destination , so i may find i have been charged for these rooms as well . In Denver the night shift gave us hotel voucher , not used and told use to go to www.unitedapprecition.com for additional information .WE WERE OFFERED 50.00 Travel Voucher !!!!!!! signed SLEEPLESS with UNITED\n",

      "I recently returned from 3 weeks in Europe after flying with BA a few times and just wanted to share my experiences I had with the airline. ---- from YVR to LHR: Departed on time, arrived at LHR 20 minutes early. I paid about $100 extra for an exit row seat (28J) and couldn't recommend this more. The seat is located in the first row in Economy, right behind Club World. After takeoff, they close the curtain and due to there being no toilets here, there's no one walking around to disturb you. My seat was right beside the door which kind of protrudes out. This was used as my leg rest for the entire duration of the flight. If you can't afford Premium Economy, this is a really great option. Dinner was a choice of pasta (with feta and tomatoes) or chicken (with rice and veggies). I had the pasta which was actually quite tasty - by no means a five star meal, but not bad for plane food. The chocolate dessert was delicious. After dinner service, lights went out and it was time to sleep. A word of warning - it's extremely cold by the exits. I had a blanket and jacket but I was still shivering throughout the entire flight. In hindsight, I'm not sure why I didn't ask for an extra blanket - I must have been delirious with sleep... Breakfast is served about an hour before landing. It consisted of a fruit muffin, yogurt, and a box of raisins (?!). Not very filling, but oh well. IFE was average - I only watched one movie before going to sleep. The new releases were nothing to get excited about, so it may be wise to bring your own entertainment. BA85 from LHR to YVR: My experience on this flight was similar to the above, except this time I had seat 29K. This is also an exit row seat but in the second row of economy with a missing seat in front which allows you to enter the aisle by walking in front (and not over your seat mates). It was a good seat but not as good as any of the exit row seats in row 28 which just feel more spacious. This flight departed a bit late and arrived 45 minutes late at YVR. I also flew from LHR to BCN (BA486), and AMS to LHR (BA435) on their smaller planes. Both plane interiors looked brand spanking new. I managed to score exit row seats on both these fights as well which was a nice bonus even though the flights were quite short in duration. There's no IFE but they do serve a small snack and free drinks on both flights. I don't know what the snacks were as I declined them on both flights. Overall, a very good experience with BA. They're definitely my airline of choice when flying to, from, and within Europe, especially if I can get an exit row seat on the international flights. Edited: 11:28 pm, July 13, 2015\n",
